<h2 class="title">2011 - now</h2>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been working at NIPO Software in Amsterdam since the beginning of 2011. We have 4 SCRUM teams delivering for the same product: NFIELD.</p>

<p><strong>NFIELD Web &amp; Mobile:</strong></p>

<p>NFIELD is a data collection platform. It&rsquo;s back-end is running on Microsoft Azure and at this moment it has 2 front-ends: Web and Android. Customers can reach NFIELD through their web browsers or using a native app on their Android devices.</p>

<p>The app and the services targeting Android devices are collectively called <a href="http://www.nfieldmr.com/" target="_blank">NFIELD CAPI</a> (computer assisted personal interviewing). The product website is <a href="http://www.nfieldmr.com/" target="_blank">www.nfieldmr.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Integrations:</strong></p>

<p>First 6-8 months of my time in NIPO Software is spent on building social media integrations for the existing data collection products. Facebook and Twitter were the two platforms that we chose to connect with. These products have become the leading examples of how market research software is done in the world of social media.</p>

<p><strong>Some technical details about what&rsquo;s keeping me busy here:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio Code.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Visual Studio Team Services (TFS in the cloud) for Version Control, Product Backlog, Canvas Board and Application Lifecycle Management activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Just like VS Team Services, we’re also using GitHub for certain parts of our software.</p></li>
<li><p>Back-end development. Scalability, resilience and fault tolerance are very important in the cloud. We use Service Bus, Message Queues, Cache Service, NoSQL and Blob data storage together with Azure SQL Databases.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re building around PaaS capabilities of Windows Azure. Our platform consists of various cloud service nodes with different types (web and worker roles). We’re closely watching every new feature in Azure since it’s the cloud platform of our choice.</p></li>
<li><p>ASP.NET MVC 4 and 5. Using C# and Razor View Engine. Heavily using Web API’s and the OWIN pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a lot of Javascript. The client facing websites we’re building are completely driven by Javascript and all data is received and sent via AJAX calls to the back end (Web API’s).</p></li>
<li><p>Using MVVM pattern on client side with Knockout.js. Talking to Web API’s in JSON. Parts of the UI are written using other Javascript templating libraries. Specifically JSRender and Handlebars.</p></li>
<li><p>Working in a SCRUM environment. Product Backlog, User Stories, Grooming Sessions, Spikes, Epics, 2 week sprints are often used terms in my daily life.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit Testing using the Moq Framework and XUnit family runners (sometimes MSTest too). We’re trying to cover as much code as possible. I like tools like NCrunch that continuously runs tests in the background as I write code.</p></li>
<li><p>Apart from Unit Tests we also create Integration Tests. We’re using both Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver. We’re gradually moving everything to WebDriver though. We create our tests using the “Page Objects Pattern”. Although we have one dedicated tester per team, in SCRUM life every type of work is meant for the whole team, so it’s common that a test task is picked up by a developer. I myself write integration tests almost every sprint.</p></li>
<li><p>Practicing TDD both for Unit and Integration Testing whenever it fits nicely with the code / feature that I’m working on. Considering tests as design tools and relying on those tests to dictate what code you need to write is a very interesting idea. This approach works pretty well for me when writing core business logic of my applications and not so when writing boilerplate framework specific code. It’s always fun to gradually convert those red tests to green though, just like checking items on a to do list.</p></li>
<li><p>We&rsquo;re also actively working on a mobile application for Android devices. Using Xamarin, C# and Nancy. This is a WebView centric Android application where interviewers can run interviews on Android devices out in the field and synchronize the data they collected with the back-end when they have connection. iOS and Windows Phone will probably be our next stops.</p></li>
<li><p>Apart from mobile revolution, market research is recently also affected heavily by Social Media. I’ve worked on extending company&rsquo;s existing products with social media extensions. I’ve built two extension applications targeting Facebook and Twitter platforms. I’ve got experience with various aspects of these development platforms.</p></li>

<h2 class="title">2007 - 2011</h2>


<p>In this section, you can find links and references to the projects that I worked on between 2007 and 2011. My role and contribution varies from one project to the other. I was an architect or lead developer for some of the projects and just crunching code for some others.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I noticed that some of these sites don&rsquo;t exist anymore. Well, quite normal if you think about the fast pace of change in online businesses. In case you need some extra information just send me a tweet or an email.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Friendhunter</strong> – <a href="http://www.friendhunter.nl" target="_blank">www.friendhunter.nl</a>
Friendhunter is a social employment website, where users (networkers) can introduce their friends (candidates) to job positions and earn some predefined bonus if the candidate is accepted by the company at the end of the interview process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Captain Cruise</strong>  &ndash; <a href="http://www.captaincruise.nl" target="_blank">www.captaincruise.nl</a>
With Captain Cruise, users can find and book reservations in cruise ships.  There is a detailed reservation process where users can pick their own cabins, meals and bed types. Along with a cruise reservation, users can book flights for connections, make hotel reservations and get travel insurances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perseuss</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://www.perseuss.com" target="_blank">www.perseuss.com</a>
This is actually an interesting project for the airlines industry.
Main purpose of Perseuss is to present a tool for the airline companies that will help them fight against fraud with their collective knowledge.
Everyday, member airline companies upload actual fraud records to Perseuss which leads to a powerful fraud database that is built with collective effort.
Airlines can also compare their sales files against this fraud database to detect suspicious sales items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micazu</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://www.micazu.nl" target="_blank">www.micazu.nl</a>
Micazu is a website where you can rent houses for a short period of time, like for vacation purposes.
It has a rather detailed payment system and payment scenarios.
It is composed of 4 separate websites, one for house renters, one for house owners, one for administration purposes and another for the back office operations.
I worked on this project occasionally when the deadlines got tight and the team needed an extra hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactiva</strong> – <a href="http://www.allesvoordehelft.nl" target="_blank">www.allesvoordehelft.nl</a>
This is a website where people can buy second hand items to a cheaper price.
Every once in a while I did some maintenance and / or functional enhancements to the website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Veiling Winnaar</strong> – <a href="http://www.veilingwinnaar.nl" target="_blank">www.veilingwinnaar.nl</a>
This is a betting website where you can buy second hand or brand new products, betting style.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vlieg Ticket Centrum</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://www.vliegticketcentrum.nl" target="_blank">www.vliegticketcentrum.nl</a>
A website where you can search for cheap flight tickets. Once you find your ticket, you’re redirected to the supplier’s web address for online reservation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bizztrip</strong> – <a href="http://www.bizztrip.com" target="_blank">www.bizztrip.com</a>
A tool that can make business people’s life easier with many integrated business trip booking facilities.
Businessmen can book flights, hotels and rent cars with this tool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TCF – Coffee Factory</strong> – <a href="http://www.coffeefactory.nl" target="_blank">www.coffeefactory.nl</a>
This is a webshop where people can collect products in their shopping baskets and buy them online.</p></li>
