<h2 class="title">I'm Hakan</h2>

A software craftsman/architect, web developer, electric guitar player, traveller and an expatriate living in the Netherlands. I love fast cars and whiskey - although never at the same time ;)

I’ve graduated from <a href="http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/" target="_blank">Sabanci University</a> with a "Computer Science & Engineering" bachelor's degree in 2005. Since then, I've been building software for various <a href="{{ root_url }}/portfolio">companies & projects</a>. Over the past years I've been particularly interested in Microsoft .NET stack and the tools around it but in recent years I started growing interest in Javascript, both as a back-end and front-end language. These days I'm spending a lot of time with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and client side frameworks like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io).

I moved to Amsterdam around 7 years ago and I'm currently working at <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a>, building the next generation data collection platforms for market research companies.

<h2 class="title">I'm working on a couple of projects</h2>
<br/>
>Always have a side project.
<a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/01/07/day-jobs-vs-side-projects/" target="_blank">There are many reasons why.</a>

* **Hackathon Planner** I'm looking for excuse projects to use and improve my node.js skills. At
NIPO Software we're organizing hackathon events a couple of times a year to have fun and create
interesting things that we can benefit from. I'm planning to create a web app that can ease the
planning phase of these hackathons. The ingredients will be [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [expressjs](http://expressjs.com), [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) and [ES6 Javascript](http://es6-features.org).

* **Ottobytes:** For more than a year me and two of my colleagues are working on a startup. We're building a product focused on market research. It's name is Kiwi. Visit the <a href="http://www.ottobytes.com/" target="_blank">
Ottobytes Website
</a> for more information about the company and its product Kiwi. I've also written two blog posts about it so far. <a href="{{ root_url }}/blog/2014/11/01/building-kiwi/">Building Kiwi</a> and <a href="{{ root_url }}/blog/2014/12/08/kiwi-updates-and-first-demo/">Kiwi - Updates & First Demo</a>. Take a look at them if it sounds any interesting. I'm learning a lot from this whole experience, both technical and non-technical.

* **This Blog:** I'd like to think of blogging as a side project too. This blog is made using Octopress (based on Jekyll) on a Mac. I've always been a Windows user, I still am. But since 2012 my main machine is a Mac. I'm learning Bash and trying to balance my time with Windows and Mac as a developer.

* **A responsive e-commerce site:** I've built a website for my parents. My parents own a couple of houses near Black Sea / Turkey. They're on sale. Click on the image to see what I've done so far (Turkish content). I keep updating it when necessary.

<h2 class="title">Podcasts that I'm subscribed to</h2>

* **.NET Rocks:** Lots of good content and fun. .NET Rocks is a classic. The name should not mislead you. This podcast is not only about Microsoft and .NET, it also covers fair amount of content outside Microsoft space. You can also find geek-out shows where they talk about non-programming related subjects such as space, barbeque, whiskey, coffee etc.

* **Hanselminutes:** <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>'s podcast. A very "to the point" podcast with good content/ad ratio. Scott Hanselman won't waste your time. This podcast is similar to .NET Rocks in the sense that it is closer to Microsoft but not limited to it.

* **Startup Podcast:** One of the most interesting show I'm subscribed to. Alex Blumberg (the guy from the famous "This American Life" podcast) documents/records the whole process of creating his company and starting a new business. Production quality is very good and storytelling is awesome. This is the description of the podcast in iTunes: "A series about what happens when someone who knows nothing about business starts one."

* **Freelancer's Show:** I've learned a lot from this podcast. It's pure gold because it covers diverse range of topics with very interesting guests each episode. Yes diverse range.. what do freelancers need to know in order to be successful? Damn.. everything!.. If you don't have time to listen the shows at least keep an eye on the <a href="http://devchat.tv/freelancers/picks" target="_blank">weekly picks</a> section because there is always very interesting content there.

<h2 class="title">A few of my favorite books</h2>
<br />

* **The War of Art**: This is maybe the book that has made the biggest impact in my life. The author Steven Pressfield has a soul-touching writing style that is both effective and expressive. This book thought me how to recognize my inner resistance, pay respect to it and keep beating it every single day.

* **$100 Startup** is a fantastic book for learning to create and sell value while doing what you love. This book is full of inspirational examples and sound strategies.

* **Charisma Myth** really demystifies the charismatic behaviors in the sense that it classifies the types of charisma, the kind of behaviors that leads to charisma and how to get there as a person without transforming your fundamental personality. This is a kind of book I want to keep next to me and remind myself of these best practices over and over again until they stick.

* **Daily Rituals: How Artists Work**: I really enjoyed reading this book. It contains daily rituals of 161 inspiring minds (novelists, poets, playwrights, painters, philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians) who have made great impact on our lives. The author covers each artist in a couple of pages. Fun and smooth reading.
