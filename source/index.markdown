<h2 class="title">Hi, I'm Hakan</h2>

I'm a software developer & architect with a passion for building quality software as effectively as possible.

I have over a decade of experience building software applications and have served as lead developer on a number of large software projects.

Throughout my career I've spent a lot of time with [Microsoft .NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) and the ecosystem around it. Working with [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) is still a big part of my life.

Next to that, I love [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) (and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), both on front-end and back-end. So I'm also working with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and with client side frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io).

I live in Amsterdam and currently working on a project at <a href="https://www.rabobank.com/" target="_blank">Rabobank International</a>, building a "Loan Quality
Assessment" application that enables credit committees to make better decisions, faster and more efficiently.  

<h2 class="title">I'm working on a few side projects</h2>
<br/>
>Always have a side project.
<a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/01/07/day-jobs-vs-side-projects/" target="_blank">There are many reasons why.</a>

* **Hackathon Planner**: NIPO Software organizes hackathon events a couple of times a year to have fun and create
interesting tools & ideas that the company as a whole can benefit from. I've been working on a web application 
that can turn the planning phase of these hackathons into a social, fun and efficient process. The ingredients 
are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com), [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) & 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [NoSQL DynamoDb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).
You can <a href="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/HackathonPlanner_Final.gif" target="_blank">see it in action here</a>.

* **Ottobytes**: Startup that I created together with two of my colleagues. We built a product called Kiwi, a data transformation solution for market research companies. Kiwi is now acquired by NIPO Software. I'm not actively working on this product anymore but I've learnt a lot from this experience. You can visit the [Ottobytes Website](http://ottobytes.com/) for more information. I also wrote [a few blog posts](./blog/categories/kiwi/) about it.

* **This Blog:** I'd like to think of blogging as a side project too. This blog is built using Octopress (based on Jekyll) on a Mac. I've always been a Windows user, I still am. But since 2012 my main machine is a Mac. I'm learning Bash and trying to balance my time with Windows and Mac as a developer.

* **A responsive e-commerce site:** I've built a website for my parents. My parents own a few houses near Black Sea / Turkey. They're on sale. Click on the image to see what I've done so far (Turkish content). I keep updating it when necessary.

<h2 class="title">Podcasts that I'm subscribed to</h2>

* **.NET Rocks:** This is a classic. Lots of good content and fun. Don't let the name mislead you. This podcast is not only about Microsoft and .NET, it also covers fair amount of content outside Microsoft space. You can also find geek-out shows where hosts talk about non-programming related subjects such as space, barbeque, whiskey, coffee etc.

* **Hanselminutes:** <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>'s podcast. A very "to the point" podcast with good content/ad ratio. Scott Hanselman won't waste your time. This podcast is similar to .NET Rocks in the sense that it is closer to Microsoft but not limited to it.

* **Freelancer's Show:** I've learned a lot from this podcast. It's pure gold because it covers diverse range of topics with very interesting guests each episode. Yes diverse range.. what do freelancers need to know in order to be successful? Damn.. everything!.. If you don't have time to listen the shows at least keep an eye on the <a href="http://devchat.tv/freelancers/picks" target="_blank">weekly picks</a> section because there is always very interesting content there.

<h2 class="title">A few of my favorite books</h2>
<br />

* **The War of Art**: This is perhaps the book that has made the biggest impact to my life. The author 
Steven Pressfield has a soul-touching writing style that is both effective and expressive. This book 
thought me how to recognize my inner resistance, pay respect to it and continuously beat it every single day.

* **As a Man Thinketh**: This 22 page book is a seminal piece on the power of thought. The author, 
James Allen, uses a language that's so powerful it moves the reader in a profound way. He explains 
and promotes the direct connection between what we think and the direction our lives take. "A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts."

* **The Obstacle is the Way**: Inspired by the ancient Stoic philosophy and personal writings of Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor 161–180 CE, this book describes the timeless art of turning trials into triumph. Teaches how to see obstacles we come across in our lives for what they really are: opportunity to get better, stronger, and tougher. What stands in the way becomes the way.

* **The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win**: One of the top recommended books for IT professionals. The Phoenix Project is a business allegory about how a fictional company becomes profitable after a crisis-driven change in its information technology management style. There are many gems in it; regarding agile workflows, devops, continuous delivery and a meaningful collaboration between IT and the business.

* **$100 Startup** is a fantastic book for learning to create and sell value while doing what you love. 
This book is full of inspirational examples and sound strategies.

<!--* **Charisma Myth** demystifies the charismatic behaviors in the sense that it classifies the types of 
charisma, the kind of behaviors that leads to charisma and how to get there as a person without transforming 
your fundamental personality.

* **Daily Rituals: How Artists Work**: I really enjoyed reading this book. It contains daily rituals of 161 
inspiring minds (novelists, poets, playwrights, painters, philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians) who 
have made great impact on our lives. The author covers each artist in a couple of pages. Fun and smooth 
reading.
