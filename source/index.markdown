<h2 class="title">Hi I'm Hakan</h2>

I’m a software engineer, web enthusiast, rock guitar player, traveller, an expatriate, a whiskey lover and sometimes a control freak.

I’ve graduated from <a href="http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/" target="_blank">Sabanci University</a> with a Computer Science & Engineering bachelor's degree in 2005. Since then I've been building software in various <a href="{{ root_url }}/portfolio">companies & projects</a> while at the same time trying to increase my and others' knowledge about software craftsmanship and it's patterns & practices. 

I moved to Amsterdam around 6 years ago and currently working at <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">Nipo Software</a>, building next generation data collection platforms for the market research industry.

<h2 class="title">I'm working on a couple of projects...</h2>
<br/>
>Always have a side project. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/?q=always+have+a+side+project#q=always+have+a+side+project" target="_blank">There are many reasons why.</a>

* One of the projects I've been working on is this blog that you're reading at the moment. This blog is made using Octopress (based on Jekyll) on a Mac. I've always been a Windows user, I still am. But since 2012 my main machine is a Mac. I'm learning the Terminal and trying to balance my time with Windows and Mac as a developer.

* I'm building a website for my parents. My parents own a couple of houses near Black Sea / Turkey. They're on sale. Click on the images to see what I've done so far... or even take a look at the <a href="http://hakant.github.io/BaskentSitesi/reference.html" target="_blank">campaign</a> that I've started (Turkish content) you may find yourself making some money.

<h2 class="title">I'm reading a couple of books...</h2>

I usually read two books at a time. One technical and one non-technical. These are the books that I'm reading at the moment:

* **$100 Startup** is a fantastic book for learning to create and sell value while doing what you love. This book is full of inspirational examples and sound strategies.

* **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** is a design patterns bible. Reading these kind of books line by line is though. Scanning them through is easier and more powerful. This way you learn what patterns are available to you. Learning the instinctive wisdom of when to bring which one is important.
