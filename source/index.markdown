description: I'm Hakan. Software Craftsman / Architect with a focus on .NET, Javascript, node.js and Azure
---

<h2 class="title">I'm Hakan</h2>

I'm a professional programmer with more than 10 years of experience building software for many companies 
in various projects.

Throughout my career I've spent a lot of time with [Microsoft .NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) and the ecosystem around it. Working with [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) is still a big part of my professional life.

On the other hand, I also have a lot of interest in [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
(and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), both for front-end and back-end purposes. These days I'm spending a lot of time with 
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and client side frameworks like [Angular](https://angularjs.org), 
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io).

I live in Amsterdam and I'm currently working on a project at <a href="https://www.rabobank.com/" target="_blank">Rabobank International</a>, building a Loan Quality
Assessment application that enables the Risk Department to make better decisions.  

<h2 class="title">I'm working on a few side projects</h2>
<br/>
>Always have a side project.
<a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/01/07/day-jobs-vs-side-projects/" target="_blank">There are many reasons why.</a>

* **Hackathon Planner** NIPO Software organizes hackathon events a couple of times a year to have fun and create
interesting tools & ideas that the company as a whole can benefit from. I've been working on a web application 
that can turn the planning phase of these hackathons into a social, fun and efficient process. The ingredients 
are [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [expressjs](http://expressjs.com), [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) & 
[ES6 Javascript](http://es6-features.org), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [NoSQL DynamoDb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).
You can <a href="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/HackathonPlanner_Final.gif" target="_blank">see it in action here</a>.

* **Ottobytes**: Startup that I created (together with two other colleagues). We built a product called Kiwi, a data transformation solution for market research companies. Kiwi is now acquired by NIPO Software. I'm not actively working on this product anymore but I've learnt a lot from this experience. You can visit the [Ottobytes Website](http://ottobytes.com/) for more information. I also wrote [two blog posts](./blog/categories/kiwi/) about it.

* **This Blog:** I'd like to think of blogging as a side project too. This blog is made using Octopress (based on Jekyll) on a Mac. I've always been a Windows user, I still am. But since 2012 my main machine is a Mac. I'm learning Bash and trying to balance my time with Windows and Mac as a developer.

* **A responsive e-commerce site:** I've built a website for my parents. My parents own a couple of houses near Black Sea / Turkey. They're on sale. Click on the image to see what I've done so far (Turkish content). I keep updating it when necessary.

<h2 class="title">Podcasts that I'm subscribed to</h2>

* **.NET Rocks:** Lots of good content and fun. .NET Rocks is a classic. The name should not mislead you. This podcast is not only about Microsoft and .NET, it also covers fair amount of content outside Microsoft space. You can also find geek-out shows where they talk about non-programming related subjects such as space, barbeque, whiskey, coffee etc.

* **Hanselminutes:** <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>'s podcast. A very "to the point" podcast with good content/ad ratio. Scott Hanselman won't waste your time. This podcast is similar to .NET Rocks in the sense that it is closer to Microsoft but not limited to it.

* **Startup Podcast:** One of the most interesting show I'm subscribed to. Alex Blumberg (the guy from the famous "This American Life" podcast) documents/records the whole process of creating his company and starting a new business. Production quality is very good and storytelling is awesome. This is the description of the podcast in iTunes: "A series about what happens when someone who knows nothing about business starts one."

* **Freelancer's Show:** I've learned a lot from this podcast. It's pure gold because it covers diverse range of topics with very interesting guests each episode. Yes diverse range.. what do freelancers need to know in order to be successful? Damn.. everything!.. If you don't have time to listen the shows at least keep an eye on the <a href="http://devchat.tv/freelancers/picks" target="_blank">weekly picks</a> section because there is always very interesting content there.

<h2 class="title">A few of my favorite books</h2>
<br />

* **The War of Art**: This is perhaps the book that has made the biggest impact in my life. The author Steven Pressfield has a soul-touching writing style that is both effective and expressive. This book thought me how to recognize my inner resistance, pay respect to it and keep beating it every single day!

* **$100 Startup** is a fantastic book for learning to create and sell value while doing what you love. This book is full of inspirational examples and sound strategies.

* **Charisma Myth** really demystifies the charismatic behaviors in the sense that it classifies the types of charisma, the kind of behaviors that leads to charisma and how to get there as a person without transforming your fundamental personality.

* **Daily Rituals: How Artists Work**: I really enjoyed reading this book. It contains daily rituals of 161 inspiring minds (novelists, poets, playwrights, painters, philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians) who have made great impact on our lives. The author covers each artist in a couple of pages. Fun and smooth reading.
