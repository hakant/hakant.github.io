<h2 class="title">Hi I'm Hakan</h2>

I’m a software engineer, guitar player, traveller, an expatriate, a whiskey lover and sometimes a control freak.

I’ve graduated from Sabanci University with a Computer Science & Engineering bachelor degree in 2005 and been programming professionally since then.

Currently I’m an employee of <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">Nipo Software</a>, building next generation data collection platforms for market research industry.

<h2 class="title">I'm working on a couple of projects...</h2>
<br/>
>Always have a side project. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/?q=always+have+a+side+project#q=always+have+a+side+project" target="_blank">There are many reasons why.</a>

* One of the projects I've been working on is this blog that you're reading at the moment. This blog is made using Octopress (based on Jekyll) on a Mac. I've always been a Windows user, I still am. But since 2012 my main machine is a Mac. I'm learning the Terminal and trying to balance my time with Windows and Mac as a developer.

* I'm building a website for my parents. My parents own a couple of houses near Black Sea / Turkey. They're on sale. Click on the image to see what I've done so far.

<h2 class="title">I'm reading a couple of books...</h2>

I usually read two books at a time. One technical and one non-technical. These are the books that I'm reading at the moment:

* **$100 Startup** is a fantastic book for learning to create and sell value while doing what you love. This book is full of inspiration.

* **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** is a design patterns bible. Reading these kind of books line by line is though. Scanning them through is easier and powerful. This way you learn what patterns are available to you. Knowing when to bring them in is important.
