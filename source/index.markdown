<h2 class="title">I'm Hakan</h2>

A software engineer, web enthusiast, rock guitar player, traveller and an expatriate living in the Netherlands. I love fast cars and whiskey - usually not together.

I’ve graduated from <a href="http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/" target="_blank">Sabanci University</a> with a "Computer Science & Engineering" bachelor's degree in 2005. Since then I've been building software for various <a href="{{ root_url }}/portfolio">companies & projects</a>. Over the past years I've been particularly interested in Microsoft .NET stack and the tools around it but in the recent years things are changing within our industry. Different technologies live together side by side as it has never been before. Freedom of choice is the king.

I moved to Amsterdam around 6 years ago and currently working at <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a>, building the next generation data collection platforms for the market research industry.

<h2 class="title">I'm working on a couple of projects...</h2>
<br/>
>Always have a side project. 
<a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/01/07/day-jobs-vs-side-projects/" target="_blank">There are many reasons why.</a>

* One of the projects I've been working on is this blog that you're reading at the moment. This blog is made using Octopress (based on Jekyll) on a Mac. I've always been a Windows user, I still am. But since 2012 my main machine is a Mac. I'm learning Bash and trying to balance my time with Windows and Mac as a developer.

* I've built a website for my parents. My parents own a couple of houses near Black Sea / Turkey. They're on sale. Click on the image to see what I've done so far (Turkish content).

<h2 class="title">Podcasts that I'm listening to...</h2>

* **.NET Rocks:** Lots of good content and fun. .NET Rocks is a classic. The name should not mislead you. This podcast is not only about Microsoft and .NET, it also covers fair amount of content outside Microsoft space. You can also find geek-out shows where they talk about non-programming related subjects such as space, barbeque, whiskey, coffee etc.

* **Hanselminutes:** <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>'s podcast. A very "to the point" podcast with good content/ad ratio. Scott Hanselman won't waste your time. This podcast is similar to .NET Rocks in the sense that it is closer to Microsoft but not limited to it.

* **Startup Podcast:** One of the most interesting show I'm subscribed to. Alex Blumberg (the guy from the famous "This American Life" podcast) documents/records the whole process of creating his company and starting a new business. Production quality is very good and storytelling is awesome. This is the description of the podcast in iTunes: "A series about what happens when someone who knows nothing about business starts one."

* **Freelancer's Show:** I've learned a lot from this podcast. It's pure gold because it covers diverse range of topics with very interesting guests each episode. Yes diverse range.. what do freelancers need to know in order to be successful? Damn.. everything!.. If you don't have time to listen the shows at least keep an eye on the <a href="http://devchat.tv/freelancers/picks" target="_blank">weekly picks</a> section because there is always very interesting content there.

<h2 class="title">I’m reading a couple of books…</h2>

* **$100 Startup** is a fantastic book for learning to create and sell value while doing what you love. This book is full of inspirational examples and sound strategies. 

* **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** is a design patterns bible. Reading these kind of books line by line is tough. Scanning them through is easier and more powerful. This way you learn what patterns are available to you. Learning the instinctive wisdom of when to bring which one is important.
