Every now and then I read about rich people trying to explain everyone else why
there is not much correlation between money and happiness or self fulfillment.

There's no doubt that one has to have access to some amount of money to realize certain layers in
the [hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
On the other hand it's a well known idea & [experience](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-day-i-became-a-millionaire-55d7dc4d8293#.7894yhemj) that more money has diminishing return on happiness:

TODO: Maybe get a couple of more examples and prepare the reader for the next section
(as a final paragraph) (look at the introduction in the book)

##Enter Flow

I've started reading this book, [Flow: The Psychology of Happiness](http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-ebook/dp/B00GO8HZIW) by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi). I've not finished it yet but it's going quite extraordinary right now.
