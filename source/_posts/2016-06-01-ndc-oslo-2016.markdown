It's time for NDC Oslo again - happening between 6-10 June 2016. I'm excited to be going there once again 
this year.

First two days I'll be taking a workshop on the topic of [microservice development (with examples in NServiceBus)](http://ndcoslo.com/workshop/microservice-development-with-examples-in-nservicebus/).
Originally the speaker was [Udi Dahan](https://twitter.com/UdiDahan) but today I saw that for 
personal reasons Udi is not going to make it to the conference anymore. Instead, now [Jimmy Bogard](https://twitter.com/jbogard) 
is going to give the workshop and I'm still up for it! I'm hoping to learn more than a few good practices and ideas
around building maintainable and resillient service oriented architectures.

After the workshop 3 day long conference goodness starts. I've been looking at the agenda for a while and marking 
the sessions that I'm interested in. I've put my list below. My plan is to attend the first session 
in each slot and see if I can watch the rest via recordings after the conference.

And if you're going to be at NDC Oslo next week and don't mind talking to strangers [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/hakant)! 
Always nice to have a few drinks and meet new folks.
