I've been writing about Hackathons and the [planner application](https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlanner) I've been busy 
with for a while now. The good news is that the Hackathon Planner has been live for a while and used by 
[NIPO Software](http://niposoftware.com/) for the last hackathon event on 25 August 2016. There have been 36 hackathon ideas
created, voted and team compositions have been made using the software. You can see it in action 
<a href="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/HackathonPlanner.gif" target="_blank">over here.</a>

But this post is about something else - as the title suggests. Something much crazier than most hackathon ideas. It is the most popular
idea of the day from my colleague Rutger de Jong: Converting [Nfield](https://www.niposoftware.com/Products/Nfield) into an online 
quiz game that can be controlled by play station buzz controllers.
