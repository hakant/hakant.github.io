Here is the list of things that I can do for you. You can always shoot me
an [email](mailto:hakantuncer@gmail.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/hakant) to contact
me. I'll be happy to talk to you or answer your questions.

## Software development

I love writing code, so obviously, I'd also like writing code for you. I can work in a team, or by myself, as necessary; remote or on-site. These days, I prefer working with

* [.NET (C#)](https://www.microsoft.com/net)
  * ASP.NET MVC
  * Web API
  * [Polyglot Persistence](http://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2015/07/what-is-polyglot-persistence/): SQL, NOSQL, Blob, Key-Value, Graph
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  * [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)  
* client side javascript frameworks for building [SPAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
  * [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
  * [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io)
  * [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)
* cloud platforms like [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

I love web programming, both front-end and back-end. I have a lot of experience
with building and maintaining large [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) systems that are scalable, resilient and
highly available. In recent years, building software for cloud platforms has been a big part of
my professional life. Especially with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com).

I'd also be interested in working with other platforms or languages but I'd first need to ramp up on those.

## Software architecture

Apart from my experience with hands-on coding and all the little details around doing that, I also have experience with system architecture. If you need help with the big picture, I may be able to help as well.

I like architectural discussions around resilience, [scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability), [idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing),
testability and tradeoffs within each layer of the [test pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html). One of the things that I'm finding interesting lately is the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).
 
I like looking at everything from an "it depends" perspective, and even more so when it comes to software architecture.

## Automated Testing

Working in agile teams taught me one important thing: to be multi-disciplined. As a result, 
I've written many types of tests (unit, component, integration, UI) while building new features.

Getting automated testing right is crucial for any company who wants to move faster without sacrificing quality.
I can help your team getting started with automated testing. I can also setup test frameworks for your 
projects. If you in fact want me to write tests for your projects, I'd also be happy to do so.

## Code reviews

If you want me to review your code, I can gladly do that too. I particularly look for issues relating to readability, encapsulation, coupling, maintainability, etc.

## Other platforms or languages outside my comfort zone?

I can also work on something that is totally new to me, or that I'm less comfortable with. Because of 
my experience with different technologies in software development, I feel comfortable about learning 
new things.

Since I also get the opportunity to learn something new from this experience, I may be glad to give 
you a discount on my rate, or we can apply a "no cure no pay" rule. It all depends on the 
circumstances and project details.
