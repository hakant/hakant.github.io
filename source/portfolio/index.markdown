I've worked at several companies. Five to be exact. I learned new things in each experience and I'm grateful for that.

<h2 class="title">2011 - now</h2>
I've been working at NIPO Software in Amsterdam since the beginning of 2011. We have 3 SCRUM teams delivering for the same product: NFIELD.

**NFIELD Web & Mobile:**

NFIELD is a data collection platform. It's back-end is running on Microsoft Azure and at this moment it has 2 front-ends: Web and Android. Customers can reach NFIELD through their web browsers or using a native app on their Android devices.

The app and the services targeting Android devices are collectively called <a href="http://www.nfieldmr.com/" target="_blank">NFIELD CAPI</a> (computer assisted personal interviewing). The product website is <a href="http://www.nfieldmr.com/" target="_blank">www.nfieldmr.com</a>.

**Social Media Integrations:** 

First 6-8 months of my time in NIPO Software is spent on building social media integrations for the existing data collection products. Facebook and Twitter were the two platforms that we chose to connect with. These products have become the leading examples of how market research software is done in the world of social media.

**Some technical details about what's keeping me busy at the office:**

* Using Visual Studio 2013 IDE.

* Backend development. Scalability and resilience is significant. We use ServiceBus, Message Queues, NoSQL and Blob data storage together with SQL Azure. 

* ASP.NET MVC 4. Using C# and Razor View Engine. Heavily using Web API’s.

* Writing a lot of Javascript. The client facing websites we’re building are completely driven by Javascript and all data is received and sent via ajax calls to the back end (Web API’s).

* Using MVVM pattern on client side with Knockout.js. Talking to Web API’s in JSON.

* Working in a SCRUM environment. Product Backlog, User Stories, Grooming Sessions, Spikes, Epics, 2 week sprints are often used terms in my daily life.

* I’ve been doing Unit Testing (we’re trying to cover as much code as possible) using the Moq Framework. Lately I’ve been a fan of NCrunch.

* Apart from Unit Testing we also have Integration Tests. We’re using both Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver. Although we have dedicated testers, in SCRUM life every work is meant for the whole team, so it’s common that a test task is picked up by a developer. 

* We're also actively working on a mobile application for Android devices. Using Xamarin, C# and Nancy. This is a Webview centric Android application where interviewers are able to run interviews on mobile devices out in the field. Both online and offline. iOS and Windows Phone may be our next stops.

* We're early adopters of Visual Studio Online. All our code, work items, build servers are on the cloud.


<h2 class="title">2007 - 2011</h2>

In this section, you can find links and references to the projects that I worked on between 2007 and 2011. My role and contribution varies from one project to the other. I was an architect or lead developer for some of the projects and just crunching code for some others.

UPDATE: I noticed that some of these sites don't exist anymore. Well, quite normal if you think about the fast pace of change in online businesses. In case you need some extra information just send me an email.

This is actually an interesting project for the airlines industry.
Main purpose of Perseuss is to present a tool for the airline companies that will help them fight against fraud with their collective knowledge.
Everyday, member airline companies upload actual fraud records to Perseuss which leads to a powerful fraud database that is built with collective effort.
Airlines can also compare their sales files against this fraud database to detect suspicious sales items.

It is composed of 4 separate websites, one for house renters, one for house owners, one for administration purposes and another for the back office operations.
I worked on this project occasionally when the deadlines got tight and the team needed an extra hand.
