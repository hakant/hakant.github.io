		<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/17/setting-up-continuous-integration-and-delivery-for-a-nodejs-rest-api/">In the first part</a> of this blog post, I shared some fundamental ideas that form as background information for what I want to achieve here. So if you haven’t read that one yet, I recommend you to <a href="/blog/2017/02/17/setting-up-continuous-integration-and-delivery-for-a-nodejs-rest-api/">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>A few months back, I decided to convert my <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">hobby project — Hackathon Planner API</a> from pure Javascript to TypeScript and <a href="/blog/2016/11/08/converting-a-node-dot-js-express-api-to-typescript/">wrote a blog post about it</a>. This time I sat down to build an Automated Test Suite and a <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous Delivery (CD)</a> pipeline around it.</p>

<p>Effective automated testing is a natural prerequisite for Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery. How can it not be? If you’re not getting quick and broad feedback from your software, how can you delivery frequently? So having a testable architecture and an effective test strategy is very crucial. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2>Right Architecture for Subcutaneous Testing</h2>

<p>I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SubcutaneousTest.html">subcutaneous testing</a>. This type of testing starts right under the UI layer with a large scope (which preferably spans all the way down to the data store) can have a great return on investment. On <a href="https://m.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/making-making-manifesto/857477870951745/">Kent Beck’s feedback chart</a> it would score high up and to the right: <strong>fast and broad feedback</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ContinuousIntegration_Part2/Kent_Beck_Feedback_Chart.png" alt="Kent Beck's Feedback Chart" /></p>

<p>So now that we want to target our automated tests below the delivery mechanism layer (UI, Network etc.), this is where an important architectural decision comes into question. What is the main boundary of my application? Where does my significant business logic start? Plus, how can I make my application boundary very visible and clear to all developers? If you follow down this path of thinking, one nice place to end up is a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">command</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern">mediator</a> patterns.</p>

<p>The combination of these patterns is about sending commands down through a very narrow facade, where every command has a very clean input and output “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">data transfer objects</a>” or POCO’s, POJO’s.. whatever you like to call them depending on your stack of choice. They’re simply objects that carry data and no behavior. </p>

<p>To be able to use this pattern in <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">my REST API</a>, I’ve created a simple module in TypeScript that allows me to execute commands and optionally get results from them. It’s here: <a href="https://github.com/hakant/TypeScriptCommandPattern">TypeScriptCommandPattern</a>.</p>

<p>In the example below, you can see how a test request is sent down to the executor and a result is returned back.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/837f08708feed35b2d02b99269f0e916.js"></script>


<p>And here is how a “Hello World” style command handler looks like. Notice that it has a clean request and response definitions. At the end of the implementation we make sure that the handler is registered and mapped to the request. In this structure handlers are singleton objects and they can later be resolved by the type of the request and then get executed.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/c4c29c9d6e98fb3a85c674a4b0ad6b28.js"></script>


<h2>Using this pattern in a real world Node.js REST API</h2>

<p>One great architectural benefit of this pattern is that it allows you to nicely separate an application into many independent scenarios — <a href="https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2015/07/02/ndc-talk-on-solid-in-slices-not-layers-video-online/">vertical slices</a>. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI/tree/master/scenarios">these scenarios from Hackathon Planner</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ContinuousIntegration_Part2/Hackathon_Planner_Scenarios.png" alt="Kent Beck's Feedback Chart" /></p>

<p>Each of these TypeScript modules are a vertical slice. They’re the full story. Yes they make use of other external modules when necessary, but when developers read through these scenarios, they get the full picture. And if code sharing between these scenarios are done wisely (with correct abstractions), then a change in one scenario is contained and does not necessarily affect any others.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the implementation of one of these scenarios and extract some key properties. Let’s pick the scenario in “GetIdeas.ts”:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/6c38b895807a4d721c8c367a5117826f.js"></script>


<ul>
<li><p>Line 3–4: Imports the base async command handling structure and also the container to register itself at the end of the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 6–9: External modules that this handler uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 11–12: A module that is used by multiple scenarios. Be careful, I say “used” not “reused”. Remember the “<a href="http://udidahan.com/2009/06/07/the-fallacy-of-reuse/">fallacy of reuse</a>”. This module (IdeaPrePostProcessor) is used to massage and sanitize the Idea entities before they’re sent to the user interface and before they’re written to the database. Multiple scenarios use this module the exact same way and for the same need. There are no slight variations per scenario, that’s why it’s a right abstraction and that’s why it’s “use”, not “reuse”.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 14–16: Since our handler is an async one (because it’s accessing the database), it implements the AsyncCommandHandler&lt;TRequest, TResponse> and implements the HandleAsync method that returns a Promise of GetIdeasReponse object.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 17–38: Complete vertical implementation of the handler. It’s basically scanning the database for all the ideas, sorting them based on an algorithm, encapsulating them in the response object and return. Notice that at line 25, the “await” keyword is used. It’s a simple and very readable way of representing asynchronous code. It exists in recent versions of TypeScript as well as in ES7.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 42–47: Request and response objects that are used by this handler are defined and exported. These objects should be available to the rest of the application as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 50–52: A singleton instance of the handler is instantiated and registered to the type of the request object. Based on application needs, this can be made more complex and sophisticated. Statically typed languages incorporate lots of ideas around IoC containers whereas dynamically typed languages like javascript, not so much. Also keep in mind that these TypeScript generic constructs only exist at design time. They don’t exist in the transpiled javascript and that makes it impossible to discover or scan these constructs at runtime.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Simple &amp; Stupid ExpressJS Routes</h2>

<p>If you have experience with building MVC type web applications or REST API’s you’re probably familiar with the idea of controllers. Routes are the same concept in <a href="http://expressjs.com">ExpressJS</a>. Keeping your routes and controllers nice and clean is a good discipline to have. Remember, we want to contain our core application logic and try not to leak it outside as much as possible. Not to frameworks, not to external libraries.</p>

<p>Hackathon Planner’s most significant route is the Ideas route where ideas are being CRUD and a few further actions are taken against them. Code below shows the routes defined in there. Notice how clean it reads and how all business logic is kept out of it. The only thing these routes do is to pass requests and responses up and down the stream.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/85fbfa3f3d77f82c2b17457a96356d09.js"></script>


<h2>Testing all the Scenarios</h2>

<p>The structure of the software created so far lends itself nicely to the subcutaneous testing style discussed earlier. So I take advantage of this by taking the following actions in the tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove the ExpressJS layer that normally sits on top. This is a delivery mechanism and I don’t necessarily need it to test my business logic — since I’ve already separated that logic clearly out of this layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Load all scenario handlers together with the real data store (or a realistic emulator).</p></li>
<li><p>Shoot requests &amp; verify responses.</p></li>
<li><p>In some cases, if verifying the response alone isn&rsquo;t sufficient, go further and directly check the data store for verifying the side effects. In my case it wasn’t necessary, I could both act and verify using my handlers alone.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let’s take a look at a few of these tests. Below is a part of <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">jasmine</a> spec that tests inserting and fetching ideas by running several scenarios.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/a2d1c53fdaa5e7c0d99eeb8e8b4022e2.js"></script>


<p>Here are a few key properties of these tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lines 17–26: Before each test new NoSql tables are created and after each test they’re dropped. This makes every test run in a sandbox isolated from one another. So they can all run in any random order. In general, this is a characteristic of a unit test, not an integration test. So here we have the best of both worlds!</p></li>
<li><p>All tests run against a DynamoDb local emulator. So the feedback coming from the database is real. I trust that the Amazon team behind DynamoDb makes sure that the emulator behaves exactly the same as the real one in the cloud.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration tests are slow right? No, not if you don’t test against user interfaces, or have many number of network calls, or use slow data storage devices. These tests don’t get into any complexity of testing against a UI; they don’t bring up a web server and make excessive number of network calls; and they make use of an in memory database emulator running on the same box. These 15 tests run in ~2 seconds even though each of them setup and tear down their data tables. So you can run quite a lot of these in a few minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>By their nature, integration tests are broad. They give broad feedback. But this is a trade off because when they fail, you have to dig a little deeper to understand exactly what failed in comparison to the unit tests that are tiny and focused. But that’s a tradeoff I like to make in general.</p></li>
<li><p>Having said that, I’m by no means trying to trash the value of unit tests here. If I see the need — like any piece of code that is significant for the system and does interesting things — I’ll go and unit test that part in isolation. Especially code that’s heavy on algorithmic work. So unit tests are valuable when they’re implemented for the right code against the right abstraction.</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, these type of tests (i.e subcutaneous) interacts with the system right at the outside of the significant boundary. This means as long as feature requirements don’t change, these tests remain valid and useful. They can survive large refactorings because they’re not coupled to the implementation details! This is a huge deal in my opinion.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In next and the last part of this series, I would like to write a few things about my experience with setting up a CD pipeline using <a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a>, which transpiles all TypeScript files, installs dependencies, runs tests and deploys to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A few months back, I decided to convert my <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">hobby project &ndash; Hackathon Planner API</a>
from pure Javascript to <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="/blog/2016/11/08/converting-a-node-dot-js-express-api-to-typescript/">wrote a blog post about it</a>.
This time I sat down to build an Automated Test Suite and a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline around it.</p>

<p>Hackathon Planner API is essentially a REST API written in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>.
Stores its data in a NOSQL database (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a>) and hosted on
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>.</p>

<p>I thought I would best write this up in 2 blog posts &ndash; due to the fact that most of what I did in this repository
is based on some fundamental concepts which I&rsquo;ve been reading and thinking about in the last few years.</p>

<p>In this post, I would like to touch on a few of these ideas that guided me in my refactoring decisions for
making the codebase cleaner, less coupled and more testable.</p>

<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll share some more details and examples from the codebase.</p>

<h2>Enabling Continuous Integation &amp; Delivery</h2>

<p>If you are not very familiar with the terms &ldquo;Continuous Integration&rdquo; (CI) or &ldquo;Continuous Delivery&rdquo; (CD) I suggest checking out
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration">ThoughtWorks website</a>
and <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Martin Fowler&rsquo;s post</a> to learn more about
these software development practices.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve intentionally used the word &ldquo;enabling&rdquo; in the title above. I&rsquo;ve seen many brownfield projects
where the team wants to start practicing CI; however, depending on the age
and size of the project this may turn out to be <strong>very difficult, sometimes even impossible</strong>. These are not
practices that can be applied to a project only from the outside. They can&rsquo;t always be easily introduced as
an afterthought either, they have to be built and enabled inside out; and it takes time &amp; effort to get there!</p>

<p>The way I see it; practicing CI or CD are kind of a &ldquo;high performance state&rdquo; a team reaches after getting A
LOT OF THINGS RIGHT; especially around system architecture and automated testing. Skills of the team members
also matter, big time! Committing to trunk everyday without breaking stuff and more importantly, always introducing
a right amount of tests at each new check-in is not an easy task for everyone.</p>

<h2>Clean Architecture</h2>

<p>One of the important lessons I learned from Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/97530863">Clean Architecture and Design</a>
(more resources <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">here</a>) is that, it&rsquo;s
almost always a good idea to keep your business logic, the heart of your system, clean from external concerns like
frameworks and delivery mechanisms (web frameworks, native application hosts, operating systems etc.).</p>

<p>This is beneficial in many ways. Keeps your business logic clean and free from the complexities of the environment around
it. It also enables great automated testing capabilities which is probably the most important prerequisite of
&ldquo;Continuous Integration&rdquo; way of working and delivering software.</p>

<p>Btw, just because I&rsquo;m referring to Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s clean architecture here doesn&rsquo;t mean I agree with everything
he&rsquo;s suggesting there &ndash; like f.ex his claim on: &ldquo;storage is an insignificant detail&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d still like to think of
storage interaction as an integral part of my system. More on that in a bit.</p>

<h2>Vertical Slices instead of Horizontal Layers</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier applications</a> where software is structured
in horizontal layers &ndash; most typical layers being Presentation, Business and Data Access. I&rsquo;ve built many
applications in this way and it&rsquo;s almost certain that I&rsquo;ll come across many others in the future.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the promise of n-tier and how did it become so widespread? I think this sentence
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">from wikipedia</a> sums it up:</p>

<blockquote><p>N-tier application architecture provides a model by which developers can create flexible and
reusable applications.</p></blockquote>

<p>In recent years; gotten tired of repeating problems introduced by organically grown n-tier applications &ndash; like
tight-coupling, bloated classes or services with multiple responsibilities,
<a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">organically introduced premature/wrong abstractions</a>;
all leading up to code that has become unreadable and hard to reason about.
You know you&rsquo;re in a &ldquo;generic, reusable n-tier application&rdquo; when you have to jump to definitions up and down
OVER AND OVER AGAIN in order get a slightest clue about what a specific scenario is trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are alternative ideas in the community. One of my favorites is the direction <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> is taking
in his talk <a href="https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2015/07/02/ndc-talk-on-solid-in-slices-not-layers-video-online/">SOLID in Slices not Layers</a>,
and his library <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR">MediatR</a> that I&rsquo;ve come to learn and love in the
last few years.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built a few applications using MediatR where I implemented all scenarios (think of these as endpoints in a
REST API) in vertical slices and kept the shared code between them to a minimum. I really enjoyed the
outcome. Readability, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)" >cohesion</a> and
<a href="https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2016/10/24/vertical-slice-test-fixtures-for-mediatr-and-asp-net-core/">testability</a>
of these applications went really up.</p>

<p>Recently I listened <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1405">Scott Allen on a podcast</a> where he mentioned
he&rsquo;s also a fan of vertical slicing and he has a <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2016/11/29/addfeaturefolders-and-usenodemodules-on-nuget-for-asp-net-core.aspx">blog post on a related idea</a>.</p>

<p>One other lecture I recommend seeing is by Udi Dahan from NDC Oslo 2016: <a href="https://vimeo.com/131757759">Business Logic, a different perspective</a>
where he talks about <a href="http://udidahan.com/2009/06/07/the-fallacy-of-reuse/">the fallacy of reuse</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I wrote a tiny <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR">MediatR</a> style
<a href="https://github.com/hakant/TypeScriptCommandPattern">application/command facade in TypeScript</a>. I do make use
of this module in <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">HackathonPlannerAPI</a> and I&rsquo;ll write more about
it in my next post.</p>

<h2>Resist the temptation of sharing and reusing code unless you have a good justification and the right abstraction</h2>

<p>Before you decide to share code between application scenarios, think twice, think three times. If you really have
to do it, make sure you build a very clear interface around that component or module. Like Udi Dahan says in his
talk (shared above), USE this component from multiple scenarios, do not RE-USE it: If you find yourself tweaking the
component for each new scenario that&rsquo;s using it, you probably got the boundary wrong. Find the right boundary or
refactor this component back into the scenarios and stop sharing/reusing it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@rdsubhas/10-modern-software-engineering-mistakes-bc67fbef4fc8#.k139s48qo">one of my favorite medium posts</a>
I&rsquo;ve read recently, the author really nails it:</p>

<blockquote><p>When Business throws more and more functionality (as expected), we sometimes react like this:

<h2>Unit or Integration&hellip; Let&rsquo;s call them all TESTING.</h2>

<p>For a good chunk of my development career, I was told that the &ldquo;unit&rdquo; in unit test is a class. So as a result,
my programming style evolved in a way that I always felt the need to design my classes with this type of testing
in mind: always being able to isolate a class from its surroundings.</p>

<p>I understand that some call this <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">Test-induced design damage</a>.
Somehow in the world of C#, using Dependency Injection and programming against interfaces still feels very natural
to me. So for me, this is not a big deal and I still find it useful to be able to swap things in and out as
necessary and in every level of my implementation.</p>

<p>However, what I&rsquo;ve come to learn eventually is this: <strong>coupling your tests to your implementation details will
kill you</strong>. Just like <a href="https://vimeo.com/68375232">Ian Cooper explains in his brilliant talk at NDC Oslo</a>. So
if you&rsquo;re writing tests for each and every single one of your classes, it&rsquo;s very likely that you&rsquo;re doing it wrong
and soon you&rsquo;ll find out that your tests are slowing you down instead of giving you the feedback and agility you
were hoping for when you started.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>find your significant boundaries</strong>. Meaningful boundaries that are composed of one or more classes and
that represent business needs. The key is this: even if your implementation details change, after let&rsquo;s say a BIG
refactoring, your tests SHOULD NOT need to change.</p>

<p>What is a better significant boundary than the whole application boundary? This is essentially what a MediatR style
pattern gives you. One narrow facade for your whole application. What a great boundary to write your tests against!</p>

<h2>Speed of tests matter but technology is changing too</h2>

<p>One big reason (heck, maybe the only reason) why people will tell you to design your system in a
way that you can swap out your database in favor of a test double (f.ex by using a repository pattern) is the speed
of tests.</p>

<p>This could be a necessary evil back in the days where databases and infrastructure was bulky and slow. But is
this still true? For <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">Hackathon Planner API project</a>
I wrote 15 tests which execute all application scenarios against a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/dynamodb-local-for-desktop-development/">DynamoDB Local Emulator</a>,
so nothing is being swapped in or out on the application side but each test sets up and tears down the NOSQL
document store &ndash; so that all tests are completely isolated from each other.</p>

<p>The result is amazing. It takes ~2 seconds to run all the tests. Let&rsquo;s say if my application grows in
size in the future and that I had to execute 300 tests, it would still take me below a minute to
run all the tests!</p>

<p>I know this example will not represent every project out there in the wild for different sorts of reasons
but when it does, it definitely blurs the line between &ldquo;Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unit&rdquo; tests in
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">the test pyramid</a>:</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. In Part 2 there will be code, I promise.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I started using TypeScript as part of a project I&rsquo;m working on. If you&rsquo;re new to TypeScript or
aren&rsquo;t yet sure about the benefits it can bring to your Javascript codebases, I recommend seeing
<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B881">this presentation from Anders Hejlsberg (Build 2016)</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about TypeScript is that it&rsquo;s a superset of Javascript, which means all Javascript
you wrote until now is already valid TypeScript. This makes it possible for anyone to come
into TypeScript and adopt it as much or as little as they want. Anders calls this &ldquo;turning the knob&rdquo;
experience. If you want to go all the way in with the type system, you can do so. Or if you only want to
use it in certain parts of your codebase, you can do that too.</p>

<p>As I learned more about TypeScript, I got convinced that I can benefit from it in most of my Javascript projects,
in particular, the ones that involve rich business domains. As an experiment, I started
converting <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">the backend of Hackathon Planner</a>, written in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, into TypeScript.</p>

<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s been a smooth experience but if
you&rsquo;re a developer yourself, you know that this type of refactorings never happen on a straight line, there
are always bumps and quirks along the way.</p>

<p>Here are a number of things I experienced as I gradually converted all of the codebase from ES6 Javascript
to TypeScript. This repository is open source and on <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlannerAPI">GitHub</a>.
TypeScript version of the code might still be on a separate branch if I haven&rsquo;t merged it yet.</p>

<h2>1. At transition, module loading can get tricky in Node.js</h2>

<p>TypeScript shares the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html">same concept of a module as ES6</a>.
TypeScript&rsquo;s module import and export syntax is very similar to its ES6 counterpart but the <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html">CommonJS
module system</a> that Node.js uses is different.</p>

<p>I wanted to slowly port my Javascript to TypeScript so that I can continue making releases in between.
Obviously, this means that part of the code would be transpiled from TypeScript while the other part is
originally Javascript. In many occasions I had to load a module from a .js file and the target
module was transpiled from a .ts (TypeScript) file. <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2719">This can cause issues</a>.</p>

<p>Look at the code below and see what happens when &ldquo;ideas.js&rdquo; has to load a module from &ldquo;AdminRepository.ts&rdquo;.
All of a sudden you have to use the &ldquo;default&rdquo; property to be able to access the exported object.
Eventually, when the consumer (idea.js) is also converted to TypeScript, the problem will go away.</p>

<br/>

<h2>2. Adding Type Definition Files to a Project</h2>

<p>Type definition files let you consume third party libraries as if they were written in TypeScript. So
you get all the benefits of type checking, intellisense and all other TypeScript design &amp; compile time
goodness even when the third party library is written in pure Javascript.</p>

<p>Before 2.0 release of TypeScript, finding and using these type definition files could get a bit <a href="https://www.davevoyles.com/2016/02/16/how-to-add-type-definitions-to-a-typescript-project/">painful and
confusing</a> &ndash;
same goes for <a href="https://medium.com/@mweststrate/how-to-create-strongly-typed-npm-modules-1e1bda23a7f4#.7ur75n1hf">creating them</a>.
TypeScript 2.0 fixed some of these issues by introducing a <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/09/22/announcing-typescript-2-0/#simplified-declaration-file-dts-acquisition">simplified declaration file
acquisition model</a>.</p>

<p>In node.js, in order to grab the underscore.js package, you&rsquo;d use:</p>

<blockquote><p>npm install underscore &mdash;save</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, if you also want to use this package from TypeScript, with strong typing, you&rsquo;ll have to download
the necessary type declaration file as well:</p>

<blockquote><p>npm install @types/underscore &mdash;save</p></blockquote>

<p>Starting with TypeScript 2.0, these type definition files are regular npm packages.</p>

<p>After downloading the type definition file, VS Code stops complaining. Furthermore, I get all type safety
features and intellisense while using this library, which is what I want and why I use TypeScript.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/types_packages.png" alt="Types Packages" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes a library you&rsquo;re using might not have a type definition file. For example, I&rsquo;m using
a passport extension library called &ldquo;passport-github2&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t have a definition file yet
(and probably never will). Inside any TypeScript file that uses this library, VSCode complains that it doesn&rsquo;t
understand this library. TypeScript compilation also results in the same error. But even though the typing file
is missing, the actual library is there and it works during run-time.</p>

<p>But of course we&rsquo;ve a problem here. The problem is that the TypeScript compiler will complain about this missing type definition file
forever. Being a good developer, what you want to do is to avoid having these kinds of error messages lying around
and being ignored.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/missing_typing.png" alt="Missing Typings" /></p>

<p>Having said this, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that
<a href="https://medium.com/@sam.verschueren/the-one-thing-that-keeps-me-from-using-typescript-839e9bd464d7#.fg5tvva5g">people are complaining</a>
about this aggressive behavior of TypeScript, as it eagerly wants all 3rd party packages to have type definition files. But
there&rsquo;s probably <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/11446">a solution coming</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, there are 2 possible solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set &ldquo;allowJs&rdquo; compiler option to true (in ts.config file). Although I should warn you that this will not only allow
third party packages to be consumed without type definitions, it will also allow any developer to put pure
javascript code into your project.</li>
<li>Another solution is to declare an <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#ambient-modules">ambient module</a>
for that library in a separate file &ndash; either marking it with &lsquo;any&rsquo; keyword or with proper types.</li>
</ul>


<p>I chose the latter, because I noticed that &ldquo;allowJs&rdquo; flag has far bigger consequences. It silences a bunch of
other types of errors/warnings which I would like to be informed about. Here is how those ambient modules
look like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/ambient_modules.png" alt="Ambient Modules" /></p>

<h2>3. Incorrect / Incomplete Type Definition Files</h2>

<p>Sometimes a type definition file (.d.ts file) turns out to be incorrect or incomplete. The screenshot
below shows a situation where the package &ldquo;aws-sdk&rdquo; has an incomplete type definition. It doesn&rsquo;t
know that &ldquo;endpoint&rdquo; property exists even though it does exist in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/gettingstartedguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.01.html">AWS documentation</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/incorrect_d.ts_file.png" alt="Incorrect type declarations" /></p>

<p>I literally went into the type declaration file I downloaded via npm and added the field &ldquo;endpoint&rdquo;
in there to fix the problem. Probably I have to commit this file into source control now. Unfortunately
I couldn&rsquo;t find a best practice that explains how to properly handle these situations. For now, I&rsquo;ll go
with the solution of manually fixing the definition file and adding it into the source control. Below you
can see the patch I made to the declaration file of AWS-SDK (line commented out).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/clientconfigpartial_d.ts.png" alt="ClientConfigPartial-AWS-SDK" /></p>

<h2>4. Dynamic Augmentation of Javascript Objects</h2>

<p>A very common pattern in javascript is to dynamically extend or augment an object with new or complementary
behavior. Here below, I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://bluebirdjs.com">bluebird.js</a> to convert a callback oriented API
to a Promise based API. All of a sudden though, TypeScript doesn&rsquo;t know about these new &ldquo;async&rdquo; methods that
bluebird has plugged into the dynamodb client.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/promisify_all.png" alt="Bluebird-Promisify-All" /></p>

<p>The solution is to either declare this object as a new interface or mark it as &ldquo;any&rdquo;,
as suggested <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8685">here</a>). I&rsquo;ve chosen the first, a more type-safe
approach, and declared my new type in the &ldquo;aws-sdk&rdquo; type declaration file, which solved the problem in
a nicer way imho. See the DynamoDBAsyncClient interface definition below:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Node_Express_TypeScript/dynamodb_async_client_declaration.png" alt="DynamoDB_Async_Client_Declaration" /></p>

<h2>5. Using import or export in your TypeScript file turns it into a module</h2>

<p>Both in TypeScript and ES6, any file containing a top-level import or export is considered a module. So
right after you use one of these keywords in your Javascript or TypeScript file, it will start behaving like
a module. I stumbled upon this while I was trying to implement an interface that I had created in a separate
file.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s first look at a simple case that doesn&rsquo;t make use of modules. Here below there&rsquo;s an interface and its
implementation right below it. See how AdminRepository.ts refers to IAdminRepository interface without
any ceremony.</p>

<br/>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/ce9a6521a16d871bb652c2f41299312d.js"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/7c25b55660deffb5556df2357ab5708b.js"></script>


<p>Now look at these other two files, in which the interface exposes a third party object and therefore has to
import that third party module. Note that index.ts can&rsquo;t just refer to that interface anymore, without
actually importing it.</p>

<br/>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/126bbcdaa477680e4ace2021f9dedd3e.js"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/88d0907ab7f3c090b4d4404a31c079c5.js"></script>


<p>By the way, I also noticed that <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines">TypeScript coding guidelines</a>
do not recommend using &ldquo;I&rdquo; as a prefix for interface names. So I need to hold my C# reflexes.</p>

<p>There are more than a few things that one has to do in order to make the TypeScript compiler happy. For anyone
with a &ldquo;Javascript mindset&rdquo; this may feel like unnecessary burden. But once you make this investment,
the amount of help and insight you get from the TypeScript compiler and tooling around it is amazing.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about hackathons and the planner application I&rsquo;ve been busy
with for a while now. The news is that <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlanner">Hackathon Planner</a> is live
and used during the last hackathon event on 25 August 2016 at <a href="http://niposoftware.com/">NIPO Software</a>.
36 hackathon ideas were created, voted and team compositions were made using the software. You can
<a href="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/HackathonPlanner_Final.gif" target="_blank">see it in action here</a>.</p>

<p>This post however, is about something else. It&rsquo;s about a crazy idea of my colleague Rutger de Jong and how we
brought it to life during that last hackathon day: Converting <a href="https://www.niposoftware.com/Products/Nfield">Nfield</a> into an online quiz game that
can be controlled by PlayStation Buzz controllers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/PlayStationBuzz.jpg" alt="Quiz Game with Play Station Buzz" /></p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>Rutger brought together five talented people from NIPO Software with diverse skills. Then he was scratching
his head (on the left) thinking &ldquo;what have I done&hellip;&rdquo; : )</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/team.jpg" alt="NIPO Software Hackathon - Team" /></p>

<h2>The Architecture</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/Architecture-Diagram.png" alt="Quiz Game - Architecture Diagram" /></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<br/>


<ul>
<li>A shared screen with a browser is opened and an online interview is started by visiting a specific URL to Nfield.
This online interview is running our little quiz.</li>
<li>Each player grabs one of the PlayStation Buzz controllers that are connected to a computer runing
a node.js application to interpret inputs coming from the controllers.</li>
<li>The online interview that was started in the browser is actually a quiz with a special template (CSS &amp; Javascript).</li>
<li>A random sequence of questions start appearing on the screen, each for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Players give their answers to each question simultaneously. These answers are received by a node.js application
listening inputs from Buzz controllers and pushes events to the app running on Hyperdev.</li>
<li>Application running on Hyperdev acts as a message hub and broadcaster. It relays the incoming messages to the quiz
running on Nfield and also to the Raspberry PI.</li>
<li>The quiz, running on the browser, receives these message (via our customized template) and picks the corresponding
answers selected by players.</li>
<li>As time is ticking away for each question, the customized template that&rsquo;s running the quiz emits events to the
Raspberry PI, telling it to buzz and blink harder.</li>
<li>Scores are continuously calculated as quiz progresses and in the end the winner is announced.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The code</h2>

<p>You can find all the code that powers this project in the following repository on GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/hakant/NfieldQuizGame">https://github.com/hakant/NfieldQuizGame</a></p>

<h2>Fun at the demo</h2>

<p>The most obvious (and fun!) demo for a quiz game is to find a number of volunteers from the audience and run a contest!
So that&rsquo;s what we did : )</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/demo.jpg" alt="Hackathon - Demo" /></p>

<p>&hellip; and here is a screenshot from the quiz:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/Quiz-Screenshot.png" alt="Hackathon - Nfield Quiz - Screenshot" /></p>

<p>All in all, once again, it was a great event at the NIPO Software office in Amsterdam. Who knows.. maybe in the very near future,
this little fun project can be put into actual use during various market research events. Without a doubt, it showcases the
power of Nfield and how customizable it is for variety of scenarios.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about each component and what it specifically does, read on.</p>

<h2>System Components</h2>

<br/>


<h4>Hyperdev.com / node.js</h4>

<p><a href="https://hyperdev.com">Hyperdev</a> is a prototyping environment where you can start up and develop a simple node.js application
right within the browser and see your application up and running live in a matter of seconds. Every time you save a file
in your project, hyperdev deploys it automatically in an amazing speed. It uses docker containers and AWS behind the scenes.
It also supports https out of the box, which was important for our purposes (Nfield services run on https so should any
integration or extension with it).</p>

<p>This node.js app running on hyperdev is our orchestrator. It is basically responsible with broadcasting incoming websocket
messages to all subscribers. Each piece of the puzzle (buzz controllers, raspberry pi and nfield) talk to this node app on
hyperdev instead of directly talking to each other, which btw would complicate things as each application would then have to
discover where the others are and be able to connect to them somehow.</p>

<p>In the architecture above, as long as everyone can reach hyperdev, successful communication is guaranteed.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Mac with Buzz Controllers / node.js</h4>

<p>While PlayStation buzz controllers are perfect for a quiz game, the immediate question for our little hackathon
project was; how do we connect to and control these things?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkkmz5VZoMQ">Node.js is everywhere</a>, it really is. There is a node package called
<a href="https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid">node-hid</a> which allows you to access USB Human Interface Devices (HID) from
node.js. It basically allows you to read from and write to these devices by using node buffers. We could even connect
these buzzers to Raspberry PI but we ran into a few security issues and pivoted to using a mac instead.</p>

<p>Of course, just being able to read the controller&rsquo;s input buffer doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean you know how to interpret it.
It speaks a certain protocol which you have to understand. While scratching our heads, we found this article:
<a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/article/84338/making-usb-c-friendly/">Working with USB devices in .NET and C#</a> where
the author describes the protocol clearly, well somewhat clearly:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/buzz-protocol.jpg" alt="PlayStation Buzz - Protocol" /></p>

<p>Long story short, each controller has a reserved space on a 6 byte area, inside which they flip bits on and off based
on the state of their buttons.</p>

<p>Here is a section of the node.js code running on the Mac that reads inputs from buzz controllers:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/7ee37ee00fccfbf487d2c6d3328f13dd.js"></script>




<br/>


<h4>Raspberry PI / node.js</h4>

<p>Since we couldn&rsquo;t succeed in reading inputs from PlayStation Buzz controllers on our Raspberry PI, we had to come up with another very useful
role for it &ndash; because we simply can&rsquo;t imagine a hackathon project without the PI (!).</p>

<p>One of our teammates said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s use it to signal remaining time at each question &ndash; with some touch of tension&rdquo;.
Then we went ahead and placed a bunch of lights on the PI and a loud buzzer. Using node.js and socket.io, it was
listening to certain type of events to start buzzing with low and high frequencies. As contestants were running out of
time while answering each question, the frequency of buzz and light effects were increasing.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Nfield Online Interviewing System / .NET, Azure</h4>

<p>Nfield Online is a data collection platform powered by NIPO Software. A SaaS platform where market research companies
can create surveys and reach their respondents. Nfield Online is bundled with a powerful domain specific
language, ODIN, created for scripting simple or complex questionnaires. Nfield also has a powerful templating system
where customers can create and run their own templates in their surveys (both for changing the look &amp; feel and behavior of
their questionnaires).</p>

<p>We used this templating system (HTML, CSS and Javascript) to tap into a running interview (in this case, our quiz) and
control it via PlayStation Buzz controllers over the internet. We also used it to send messages to the Raspberry PI
to indicate remaining time per question.</p>

<p>When this template is activated on the interview, which is running our quiz, it connects to the socket.io server
on hyperdev and starts listening to &ldquo;button pressed&rdquo; events from PlayStation Buzz controllers. When a button
is pressed it receives the event and selects the corresponding answer on the quiz for that contestant.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project and also writing about it in this blog. Every
technology company should make hackathons a part of their culture. The benefits might not be immediately clear
in the beginning but all those doubts disappear after a few events.</p>

<br/>

		<p>In my <a href="/blog/2016/06/01/ndc-oslo-2016/">previous post</a> I&rsquo;d talked about my plans in NDC Oslo, including<br/>
all the sessions and the 2-day workshop I was planning to attend.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a great experience. I came back with good memories and learned a few things too. NDC conferences usually
feature high quality content and good speakers, this one also lived up to the expectations.</p>

<p>I would like to share some of the highlights of the conference which, of course, are based on my perspective
and interests.</p>

<h2>Workshop: &ldquo;Microservice development&rdquo;</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/Microservices-Development-Workshop-1.jpg" alt="Microservices Development Workshop" /></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> and two employees from <a href="http://particular.net/nservicebus">Particular Software</a> ran the workshop. As it happens with all these type
of workshops, nearly half of the content was sort of a beginner to intermediate level while the other half was
covering more advanced and interesting scenarios. Here are some of my highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Services are automonous. They don&rsquo;t rely on other services to do their work. They also own their own
SLA &amp; uptime. They should have explicit boundaries and own their own data.</p></li>
<li><p>Isolation of services enable the use of different languages and frameworks per service. However, rather than using the
freedom of choosing a different language, it is more useful to have services choose their own data store. Homogenity
on the application side and heterogenity on the data side is more encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating service boundaries for actually solving business problems is a good idea. Take a good look at the
business domain and how it&rsquo;s compartmentalized within your company. Model your services around that structure. A
straightforward example of this is to create a service per business department or independent business unit.</p></li>
<li><p>We talked about messaging patterns. A lot of boilerplate code around messaging is handled for you by a product
called <a href="http://particular.net/nservicebus">NServiceBus (from Particular Software)</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using commands only within a service boundary.</li>
<li>Using events within and across service boundaries.</li>
<li>Once you separate your service into a number of granular command and event handlers, try to be as &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; as
possible inside each of these handlers &ndash; avoid using complex patterns and abstractions as much as possible
(this at least is what Jimmy is advising).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When building an SOA (service oriented architecture), the rule of thumb is that the first line public
service can call multiple downstream services to aggregate data but those services should never call other services.
Thus, the depth of services that are called are never more than one. This principle will help you avoid
complexity and possible high latency.</p></li>
<li><p>For this reason above (downstream services don&rsquo;t call other services) an example in the workshop used a
technique where a service codebase contains public interfaces which can be implemented by other services and shared
during development time (as nuget packages). <a href="https://github.com/Particular/Workshop/tree/master/exercises/src/04%20Integration/after/Divergent.ITOps.Interfaces">Check this code</a>
for an example of this use case.</p>

<ul>
<li>As an example, if sales domain needs to get something from customer domain, sales service
declares an interface and customer service supplies the implementation to that service.</li>
<li>This means that one service doesn&rsquo;t call the other one at runtime but instead runs that piece of code directly.</li>
<li>Note that this removes the runtime dependency but introduces development time dependency. If you&rsquo;re doing
microservices mostly for reasons around team composition and independence, this might sound less attractive to
you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You can find all workshop exercises <a href="https://github.com/Particular/Workshop">here on GitHub</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conference Highlights</h2>

<br/>


<h3>Erlang is cool, so is functional programming!</h3>

<p>Functional programming was a large and popular track in NDC Oslo. Created a lot of buzz for sure. This photo
below was taken at the end of conference day 1. I believe at the end of the conference <em>#fsharp</em>, <em>#erlang</em>, <em>#phoenix</em>
and <em>#elixir</em> were all sitting high in this top 10 list as some of the most spoken technologies.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/NDC-Oslo-Twitter-Buzz.png" alt="NDC Oslo Twitter Buzz" /></p>

<p>I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Erlang</a> for the first time and found it
quite interesting. In Wikipedia, Erlang is described as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language. It is also a garbage-collected runtime system.
Erlang is known for its designs that are well suited for systems with the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distributed</li>
<li>Fault-tolerant</li>
<li>Soft real-time</li>
<li>Highly available, non-stop applications</li>
<li>Hot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Do any of these sound familiar? Welcome to the cutting edge stateful microservices technology, from 1986!</p>

<p>Lightweight processes are the main building blocks of an Erlang application:</p>

<blockquote><p>Processes are the primary means to structure an Erlang application. They are neither operating system processes
nor operating system threads, but lightweight processes that are scheduled by Erlang&rsquo;s BEAM VM.</p></blockquote>

<p>Based on my first impressions I found many conceptual similarities between Erlang and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/">Service Fabric</a>: the idea of
stateful and stateless services messaging each other. Erlang doesn&rsquo;t have the concept of replicas (unlike Service Fabric),
all process nodes are peers &ndash; no primary &amp; secondary relationship. Which means if a process crashes the state is
gone. Of course there are solutions to this &ndash; like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnesia">Mnesia</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My gut feeling after learning more about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/erlang?src=hash">#erlang</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ndcoslo?src=hash">#ndcoslo</a> : <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/servicefabric?src=hash">#servicefabric</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/erlang?src=hash">#erlang</a> plus some (large) churn.I still love <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csharp?src=hash">#csharp</a> though</p>&mdash; Hakan Tuncer (@hakant) <a href="https://twitter.com/hakant/status/741296386856095744">June 10, 2016</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be looking into Erlang, <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> and
<a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> because I&rsquo;m sold to the idea that these things are pretty powerful to ignore.</p>

<br/>


<h3>Head to head session with questions from Stack Overflow</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/head-to-head.jpg" alt="Head to head with Scott and Jimmy" /></p>

<p>Both <a href="https://twitter.com/odetocode">Scott Allen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> are proponents of testing with less mocking. Jimmy said he doesn&rsquo;t like
using in memory database tricks or any other unrealistic testing styles. A few tricks that he spoke of were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using database transactions without commiting in the end &ndash; to get back to a reset state after each test.</li>
<li>Using a nuget package called <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/Respawn">Respawn</a> that can cleanup the
database after each test in a clever way.</li>
<li>Using real storage during tests has been beneficial to these guys according to them (less unforeseen bugs).</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<h3>.NET Core is shaping up nicely</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/dot-net-core.jpg" alt=".NET Core - Mark Rendle" /></p>

<p>ASP.NET Core looks beautiful even though the roadmap had its fair share of ups and downs for a long period. The
talk about making the Kestrel web server performant is fantastic. It turns out that creating a very performant web
server takes ridiculous amount of code optimizations. Must watch. Actually most .NET Core talks were very
interesting.</p>
