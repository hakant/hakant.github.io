	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I think most professionals who design product interfaces (both physical or software interfaces) will agree
that simplicity and discoverability of an interface is a big winning factor. Simple and discoverable
interfaces are usually self explanatory and for this very reason they tend to provide great user
experiences.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should stop providing documentation or user manuals for our
products. A discoverable user interface with a clean, easily accessible documentation is I think what
every product deserves.</p>

<p>When it comes to user manuals or guides, I&rsquo;m so much in favor of a user manual that&rsquo;s deeply connected or
embedded to the user interface rather than a pile of content parked somewhere completely disconnected from
the actual product.</p>

<p>UI embedded manuals can be designed in many ways, one of which is through a concept called &ldquo;App Walkthrough&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>App Walkthrough</h2>

<p>From a conceptual point of view I knew what an app walkthrough is for a very long time but before I sat down
to write this post I was tempted to call it &ldquo;in-app tutorials&rdquo;. After some searching around the topic, I
discovered that it actually has a <a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/ux-flows-how-when-to-design-app-walkthrough">common name</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A walkthrough is the process of intentionally revealing functionality to a user.</p></blockquote>

<p>Implementing a successful app walkthrough is <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-instructional-overlay/">not an easy endeavour at all</a>.
It&rsquo;s like a double edged sword. If you <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/07/how-to-design-a-successful-web-app-walkthrough/">get it right</a>
it&rsquo;s all unicorns and butterflies. If you get it wrong you can do more harm than good.</p>

<h2>Implementing one for Hackathon Planner</h2>

<p>A couple of days ago I started flirting with the idea of implementing a walkthough for the <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlanner">Hackathon
Planner</a>. This is what came out:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/App_Walkthrough/Hackathon-Planner-Walkthrough.gif" alt="Hackathon Planner Walkthrough" /></p>

<p>You can try it by visiting the <a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">Hackathon Planner preview website</a>.
It is designed to be viewed only once and then gets out of the way forever. There are two things that I still
want to add to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A quick opt out button on each individual step of the walkthough so that users have an easy way to exit
the tutorial without being forced to complete it.</li>
<li>An overlay that makes the UI frozen while the tooltips are running. If a user doesn&rsquo;t follow the
tooltip popovers and starts clicking around, things get messy (and this is bound to happen if I
know a thing or two about users).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Show me the code</h2>

<p>Inside the Aurelia app, I&rsquo;ve created a component called &ldquo;<em>TooltipService</em>&rdquo; which is responsible for
orchestrating the walkthrough. There&rsquo;s also a separate data holder class &ldquo;<em>Tooltips</em>&rdquo; that declaratively defines all walkthrough
steps and their contents, positions etc.</p>

<p>Tooltips are created using the <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/popovers/">popover component from Bootstrap 4</a>
(still in alpha at the time of this writing).</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>~2 months ago <a href="/blog/2016/01/30/hackathon-planner-for-nipo-software/">I wrote about Hackathon Planner</a>
and hustled the idea as a candidate project for the next hackathon at NIPO Software. Then the hackathon day arrived.
We formed a team of 6 and spent a day working on it. Rutger shot a time lapse video from that day.</p>

<br/>




<iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMK8vvJm87A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Since then, I continue working on the Hackathon Planner whenever I find some free time here and there. Rutger also
occasionally shows up in the commit history contributing with his CSS superpowers.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> everyday at work and this time I want to experiement with
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. I&rsquo;ve put up an <a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">early preview of Hackathon Planner</a>
on Amazon S3. I&rsquo;ll keep updating it from this point on. At the time of this writing, it&rsquo;s only a client
side preview &ndash; actions are only saved on the local storage of the browser. Not very useful yet but it soon will be.
<a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">Check it out.</a></p>

<h2>Aurelia</h2>

<p><a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia</a> has been my framework of choice for this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single page application</a>. It truly is a great framework in
the sense that it really gets out of your way. After I learned some of the fundamentals of Aurelia, I was basically
good to go. Some periods I even forgot that I was using a framework because it is simply not in your face. Let me
show you some code samples from the project.</p>

<br/>


<h4>ES6 and ES7 in action</h4>

<p>Aurelia takes advantage of the latest javascript standards as much as possible. Take a look at this &ldquo;nav-bar&rdquo;
component from the Hackathon Planner.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/27562e37df6d7bf59f24fd12b316045a.js"></script>


<ul>
<li>First three lines are an example of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import">ES6 module importing</a>.
This is how a javascript module can make use of code from external libraries.</li>
<li>Line #5 is an example of an <a href="https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841#.5obmn2df6">ES7 Decorator</a> that is in this case
<a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/aurelia-update-with-decorators-ie9-and-more/">used by Aurelia for dependency injection</a>.
Basically we&rsquo;re telling Aurelia to pass those components as constructor arguments to the NavBar component.</li>
<li>And the rest of the code is the NavBar class that is written based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class specification</a>.
See how clean this component is &ndash; it&rsquo;s pure javascript.</li>
</ul>


<br/>  


<h4>Dynamic application root</h4>

<p>Code below is the entry point to the Hackathon Planner: &ldquo;main.js&rdquo;.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/8c94080e4c61ea04bfaf1a009dbcc25b.js"></script>


<ul>
<li>Line #2 imports a custom authentication service that I wrote and it gets resolved as a singleton instance at line #13.
In Aurelia all dependencies are registered as singleton by default (unless you specify it otherwise).</li>
<li>Based on the authentication status (line #14) aurelia app root is set either to the app or to the login
component. The ability to set arbitrary application roots is a powerful feature of Aurelia that enables some
<a href="http://patrickwalters.net/creating-multipage-apps-using-aurelia-2/">interesting scenarios</a>.</li>
<li>I borrowed this idea from <a href="http://davismj.me/blog/aurelia-auth-pt2/">Matthew James Davis</a>.</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<h4>Validation</h4>

<p>Aurelia also comes with a <a href="https://github.com/aurelia/validation">validation plugin</a> and <a href="http://blog.durandal.io/2016/03/23/aurelia-babel-6-and-jspm-update/">it&rsquo;s currently undergoing some big refactoring</a>.
It still wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to show how it looks like at the moment. Note that the @ensure decorator is recently
deprecated (which means I&rsquo;ll also need to adapt this code going forward).</p>

<p>This is a stripped down version of the project class in Hackathon Planner:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/69363eaf32e2052d2d2697335704555e.js"></script>


<ul>
<li>Line #8 and #10 sets validation rules on those properties and line #20 initializes the validation for this
object.</li>
</ul>


<p>And this event handler in &ldquo;new-card.js&rdquo; validates a project before adding or updating it:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/bbb87af2f2306724bbd1981973b8d83f.js"></script>


<br/>


<h4>Beautiful components</h4>

<p>In Aurelia, user interface components are composed of <a href="http://aurelia.io/docs.html#/aurelia/framework/1.0.0-beta.1.1.4/doc/article/creating-components">view and view-model pairs</a>.
These two are created by Aurelia&rsquo;s dependency injection framework and gets linked to each other via data binding.</p>

<p>Here is one of those pairs from the Hackathon Planner. This is how the overview page is rendered:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/6ab1a376f50b80bd115f765e16a551f4.js"></script>




<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/7296309c6a7166254ac701a6b27caf47.js"></script>


<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Notice how a component is required into a template at line #2.</li>
<li>And then all projects are looped through and each one is rendered into another component called &ldquo;idea-card&rdquo;
at line #5.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thank you for reading and make sure you check out the <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlanner">Hackathon Planner on GitHub</a>
and <a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">its early preview deployment</a>.</p>

		<p>I learn best by practicing. When I only read (i.e no practicing, no note taking), I almost completely forget what I learned after a month or two. I think most people are wired this way. Think about a book you read 6 months ago and see how much of it you can still remember. It&rsquo;s scary.</p>

<p>Learning something new in programming is no different. Maybe even worse. But there&rsquo;s good news, because in programming <a href="http://jamesclear.com/learning-vs-practicing">learning by practicing</a> is very easy. You just need a computer and that&rsquo;s it! And hey, now we&rsquo;re in the cloud era. If you need more, go and get what you need with a couple of clicks! It&rsquo;s crazy how much programmers can do these days while sitting on a couch with a cup of coffee. You just need some time and passion. The rest is simply there available for you to grab.</p>

<h2>Hackathons</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathons</a> are a great way of <a href="http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2015/04/29/learning-doing-helps-students-perform-better-science">learning by doing</a> and we at <a href="http://niposoftware.com/">NIPO Software</a> have started making this a company tradition for a year or so, thanks to my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/qaidj">Qa&#8217;id Jacobs</a> who took the first initiative and continues to put effort into organizing them. Below are some pictures from our last hackathon around summer of 2015.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Hackathon_Planner/Hackathon_NIPO_1.jpg" alt="NIPO Software Summer 2015 Hackathon 1" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/Hackathon_Planner/Hackathon_NIPO_2.jpg" alt="NIPO Software Summer 2015 Hackathon 2" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/Hackathon_Planner/Hackathon_NIPO_3.jpg" alt="NIPO Software Summer 2015 Hackathon 3" /></p>

<p>One of the ideas during this hackathon was building a &ldquo;Hackathon Planner&rdquo;. It didn&rsquo;t get enough love, so was never picked up. Currently all ideas and team compositions are kept and maintained in an Excel file &ndash; the best and the worst tool of all times in computing history. So how about building a planner that can help people capturing ideas and forming teams around those ideas in a fun way?</p>

<h2>A Hackathon Planner &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a></h2>

<p>A minimum viable hackathon planner;</p>

<ul>
<li>should be open source (not only <a href="http://niposoftware.com/">NIPO Software</a>, anyone or any company should be able to make use of it if they want to do so).</li>
<li>should allow capturing of ideas in a modern way (I hear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPAs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, subtle animations, web sockets, responsive design).</li>
<li>should allow simple ways of reacting to those ideas (i.e sending likes and possibly comments in the future).</li>
<li>should be simple to sign up and login (built in GitHub authentication?).</li>
<li>should allow a simple way of forming teams (mark the idea/team that you want to join and done!).</li>
<li>should allow live monitoring of teams as they form and evolve. It makes the team formation process more exciting to follow. Watching as ideas live and die (<a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr">signalR</a>,  <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> ?).</li>
</ul>


<p>Based on these thoughts above I&rsquo;ve created a very basic sketch that can give a general idea:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Hackathon_Planner/Hackathon_Idea_Details.png" alt="Hackathon Planner - Mockup" /></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much into <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> these days. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be using. Sure I&rsquo;ll throw in a NoSQL database too and see how much these decisions will hurt me during production.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard/">@jbogard</a> putting it nicely:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">one thing i try very hard to do is to not promote any tool/language/framework/platform/pattern until i&#39;ve had to support it in production</p>&mdash; Jimmy Bogard (@jbogard) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard/status/691992462483677184">January 26, 2016</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I recently have this theory: How cool a platform, framework, database or a language is directly proportional to the amount of pain one will get during production support.</p>

<p>So we’ll see how this one goes with the choices that I made.. if I can stop slacking off and get to finish the MVP of course.</p>

		<p>Every now and then I read about rich people talking about the correlation between money, happiness and self fulfillment. More often than not, it&rsquo;s the lack of correlation that they talk about.</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I&rsquo;ve started reading this book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-ebook/dp/B00GO8HZIW">Flow: The Psychology of Happiness</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>. It starts with a simple claim:</p>

<blockquote><p>We humans have a built-in dissatisfaction with what we have and what we own. Material world does not make us happy. Unless we can moderate this dissatisfaction and start enjoying the moment we&rsquo;ll be disappointed.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has always made perfect sense to me. Materials by themselves aren&rsquo;t worth anything. At the end of the day it all comes down to what we do with them, or most importantly, what we actually do with our lives.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another excerpt from a WSJ article <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/can-money-buy-happiness-heres-what-science-has-to-say-1415569538">&ldquo;Can Money Buy You Happiness?&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In short, this latest research suggests, wealth alone doesn’t provide any guarantee of a good life. What matters a lot more than a big income is how people spend it. For instance, giving money away makes people a lot happier than lavishing it on themselves. And when they do spend money on themselves, people are a lot happier when they use it for experiences like travel than for material goods.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Enter Flow</h2>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been discovering that flow is one of the sources of happiness in life (maybe the most powerful one!). It is also a very rewarding state to be in. Pleasure is also a source of happiness, but unlike pleasure, the enjoyment that comes with flow leads to growth and higher levels of complexity.</p>

<p>Flow is defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">Wikipedia</a> as:</p>

<blockquote><p>In positive psychology, flow, also known as the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does.</p></blockquote>

<h2>8 Major Conditions of Flow</h2>

<p>In his book, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes the 8 components of flow-like activities. Know these conditions and try to apply them to what you do everyday.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Clear Goals.</strong> Knowing what we have to do very clearly. Not only the big goal, but also each step of these activities should be well defined. Playing chess, tennis or a musical instrument naturally falls into these type of activities, but with a bit of conscious effort we can apply this idea to many day to day activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong> Immediate Feedback.</strong> Knowing how well we are doing. Getting clear and constant flow of feedback. Not having this type of feedback makes it easier to get distracted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges of the activities are met with the right level of skills of the person.</strong> What needs to be done is in balance with what we can do. When a job is hard, demanding or very easy we can get stressed or distracted. If it&rsquo;s a match, then it becomes enjoyable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feeling a focus and concentration on what you&rsquo;re doing.</strong> In flow, the split attention (that we usually have) focuses into a single beam of attention. Here we can achieve so much more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Everyday&rsquo;s frustrations are gone.</strong> During flow, we don&rsquo;t worry about anything anymore because our mind is not wandering &ndash; no future, nor past. It&rsquo;s a form of escape from the real world and creating different realities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You feel that you can be in control of your life, your actions, your experience.</strong> The sense of control is a great feeling, it&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t feel during our everyday lives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loose a sense of subconsciousness &ndash; the ego defense.</strong> We usually worry about how other people think of us. It&rsquo;s a feeling of self-monitoring, a state of defensiveness, a frequent questioning of how we look and so on. During flow we go beyond ego (transcendence). One of the paradoxes of flow is that during the experience we forget about ourselves but after the experience we come back stronger, because we know that we&rsquo;ve accomplished something and that makes a positive impact on our self confidence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sense of time seems to be transformed.</strong> During flow, sometimes hours get condensed into minutes. Sometimes a couple of seconds feel like minutes, because so much is packed in the moment (for physical activities). Time adopts itself to your activities rather than the other way around. Rather than you boxing your life into time, you can change the time.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Flow vs Agile teams &amp; Open Offices</h2>

<p>Programming is a great flow-like activity. It also naturally fits all conditions above, and yet the agile movement and the open-office model has started an open season on flow: <strong>kill on sight!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done a <a href="https://www.google.nl/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=open+offices+productivity">google search on &ldquo;open office productivity&rdquo;</a> and it seems like in the last few years it has attracted a lot of negative criticism. Some examples are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/30/google-got-it-wrong-the-open-office-trend-is-destroying-the-workplace/">&ldquo;The open-office trend is destroying the workplace&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/open-office-backlash-seeking-productivity-in-a-noisy-world/">&ldquo;Open-Office Backlash: Seeking Productivity in a Noisy World&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/currency-tag/the-open-office-trap">&ldquo;The open-office trap&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much consensus around the topic. Facebook is the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/08/25/facebook-unveils-new-campus-will-workers-be-sick-stressed-and-dissatisfied/#f08022b13351">biggest fan of the open-office model</a> while Stack Overflow made it clear that <a href="https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/why-we-still-believe-in-private-offices/">they still believe in private offices</a>. It also appears that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140911-open-office-victims-push-back">Microsoft is still pushing back the open-office trend</a> by saying: &ldquo;Too much togetherness can sap productivity and creativity&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Does flow matter to you? And how do you like to work within your team?</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><a href="/blog/2015/05/02/devintersection-and-anglebrackets-in-phoenix/">I was at DevIntersection Conference</a> in Phoenix around mid May 2015. Apart from the regular conference schedule, I took a few interesting workshops one of which was &ldquo;Zen of Architecture&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/741">Juval Lowy</a>.</p>

<p>As the name clearly implies one day workshop was all about software architecture and the ways to approach it. Juval talked about a method that he uses for decomposing systems and making design decisions.</p>

<p>It was a full day of content storm with as little breaks in between as possible (this is the Juval style I suppose). I&rsquo;ve been reviewing my notes and presentation slides thinking this can become a book if I try to write everything. So instead, this post focuses on a certain part of the workshop which I think covers the core idea.</p>

<h2>The Method</h2>

<p>Juval introduces a method which he calls &ldquo;The Method&rdquo; for decomposing a system. Achieving the right decomposition of a system is one of the most important things in software architecture. The end result of your decomposition is your architecture.</p>

<blockquote><p>For the beginner architect, there are many options<br/>
For the master architect, there are only a few</p></blockquote>

<h2>Functional Decomposition</h2>

<p>The biggest sin of any software architect. Never ever do functional decomposition!</p>

<br/>


<h4>What is it?</h4>

<ul>
<li>This is also known as the flow-chart decomposition.</li>
<li>Basing services and system components on the order of logical steps in use cases.</li>
<li>Decomposing the system based on features, functional requirements and time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Juval emotionally talks about &ldquo;functional decomposition&rdquo; easily for more than an hour. Can&rsquo;t repeat enough how bad it is and how we&rsquo;re all guilty of doing it from time to time and why we should be very conscious about resisting our bad habits. Say &ldquo;functional decomposition&rdquo; to Juval one more time and he&rsquo;ll kill you right there without blinking.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Why is it so bad?</h4>

<ul>
<li>It leads to duplicating behaviors across services.</li>
<li>It leads to explosion and bloating of services and intricate relationships inside and between them.</li>
<li>It couples multiple services to data contract.</li>
<li>Promotes implementing use cases in higher level terms thus difficult to reuse same behavior in another use case.</li>
<li>Couples services to order and current use cases.</li>
<li>Prevents single point of entry.</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<h4>Example of Functional Decomposition</h4>

<p>Here are  a few slides from the workshop that shows Functional Decomposition in action.</p>

<h2>Volatility-Based Decomposition</h2>

<p>If you would learn one thing from this entire course this should be it, Juval mentioned repeatedly. <strong>You should always decompose a system based on volatility.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Identify areas of potential change and encapsulate them in services.</li>
<li>Look for functional potential changes but <strong>not domain functional</strong>. Meaning that while looking for volatility, don&rsquo;t speculate on potential changes to the nature of the business. Don&rsquo;t overdo it.</li>
<li>Implement behavior as interactions between services or subsystems.</li>
<li>Create your milestones based on integration of these services not features.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is the universal principle of good design says Juval. Encapsulate change to insulate. Do not resonate with change. Functional decomposition on the other hand maximizes the impact of change because it&rsquo;s coupled to it.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Challenges with Volatility-Based Decomposition</h4>

<p>There are challenges in creating a Volatility-Based Decomposition. First of all it usually takes longer than functional because volatility is not often self evident. On the other hand features are kept thrown at your face. People around you are feature thirsty, they&rsquo;ll keep asking for their features. You should instead fight the insanity and focus on the bigger picture and volatilities. Getting the management support is usually another challenge. Juval said architects should be responsible, fight against these opposing forces and do what is right.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Axes of volatility</h4>

<p>There are two axes of volatility.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the same customer over time</li>
<li>At the same time across customers</li>
</ul>


<p>These axes should be independent from each other. So encapsulate them from each other as well. When they&rsquo;re not independent it&rsquo;s a sign of functional decomposition.</p>

<p>Prior to architecture and decomposition, as part of requirements gathering and analysis, prepare a list of areas of volatility. Ask what could change along the axes of volatility.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Example of Volatility-Based Decomposition</h4>

<p>Below, you&rsquo;ll find 5 slides from the workshop that brainstorms on possible volatilities of a trading system. Here are some guidelines for capturing volatility:</p>

<ul>
<li>The objective is to have a mindset of &ldquo;what could possibly change?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Capturing the areas of volatility earlier is better than later. The later you figure it out the more it will cost you.</li>
<li>Once settled on the ares of volatility encapsulate them in components of architecture.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need an exhaustive list. This is a process of diminishing returns. Don&rsquo;t overdo it.</li>
<li>Some volatile areas may relate too much to the nature of your business. This type of volatility is out of your scope.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2026.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2027.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2028.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2029.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2030.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2032.jpg" style="border: solid;"></p>

<br/>


<h4>Let&rsquo;s analyze this decomposition.</h4>

<p>Transition from list of areas of volatility to services is hardly ever pure 1:1. Sometimes a single service encapsulates multiple areas. Some areas may map to an operational concept or may be encapsulated in a third party component.</p>

<p>Always encapsulate the data storage volatility behind data access services. Encapsulate where the storage is, what technology is used to access it and refer your storage as storage, not as database or whatever the actual technology is.</p>

<p>Following 3 slides do further analysis of the decomposition in this example. Please refer to the diagram above as you read the key points:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2034.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2035.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2036.jpg" style="border: solid;"></p>

<h2>Decomposition and Business</h2>

<p>Avoid encapsulating changes to the nature of your business. Because</p>

<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll need it very rarely</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll be diving into speculation and speculation based design trap</li>
<li>when you do it you&rsquo;ll probably do it very poorly because there are too many unknowns (and again speculations)</li>
</ul>


<p>While designing a system for your business don&rsquo;t only focus on your own also keep your competitor in mind. Design both for you and your competitor. This is a useful posture in designing systems and it&rsquo;s not about features or functionality but it&rsquo;s about understanding the nature of the business. Keeping your competitors in mind and not only focusing on your own business will help you understand the nature of the business even better. This way you can have a better judgement about what is volatile and what is not.</p>

<h2>Decomposition and Longevity</h2>

<p>Volatility is very closely tied to longevity. The longer things do not change the longer they have till they do change or are replaced. The more frequently things change the more likely they would change in the future.</p>

<p>You must take into account impact from change regardless of your requirements. Ask yourself what has changed over the past 5-7 years and what will change in the next 5-7 years. Encapsulate things that would change within the life of your system.</p>

<h2>Further topics</h2>

<p>For the rest of the day Juval dived into</p>

<ul>
<li>layered architectures</li>
<li>typical layers</li>
<li>definition of managers, engines, resource access services and differences between them</li>
<li>open and closed architectures</li>
<li>what not to do when using &ldquo;the method&rdquo;</li>
<li>creating call graphs within system components and observing/revealing anti-patterns</li>
<li>a bonus section called &ldquo;what about agile?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all it was a mind tickling workshop and I hope I could give you more than only a taste. I may write other posts about the bullet points above if/when I find the time.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>
