	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about hackathons and the planner application I&rsquo;ve been busy
with for a while now. The news is that <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlanner">Hackathon Planner</a> is live
and used during the last hackathon event on 25 August 2016 at <a href="http://niposoftware.com/">NIPO Software</a>.
36 hackathon ideas were created, voted and team compositions were made using the software. You can
<a href="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/HackathonPlanner_Final.gif" target="_blank">see it in action here</a>.</p>

<p>This post however, is about something else. It&rsquo;s about a crazy idea of my colleague Rutger de Jong and how we
brought it to life during that last hackathon day: Converting <a href="https://www.niposoftware.com/Products/Nfield">Nfield</a> into an online quiz game that
can be controlled by PlayStation Buzz controllers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/PlayStationBuzz.jpg" alt="Quiz Game with Play Station Buzz" /></p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>Rutger brought together five talented people from NIPO Software with diverse skills. Then he was scratching
his head (on the left) thinking &ldquo;what have I done&hellip;&rdquo; : )</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/team.jpg" alt="NIPO Software Hackathon - Team" /></p>

<h2>The Architecture</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/Architecture-Diagram.png" alt="Quiz Game - Architecture Diagram" /></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<br/>


<ul>
<li>A shared screen with a browser is opened and an online interview is started by visiting a specific URL to Nfield.
This online interview is running our little quiz.</li>
<li>Each player grabs one of the PlayStation Buzz controllers that are connected to a computer runing
a node.js application to interpret inputs coming from the controllers.</li>
<li>The online interview that was started in the browser is actually a quiz with a special template (CSS &amp; Javascript).</li>
<li>A random sequence of questions start appearing on the screen, each for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Players give their answers to each question simultaneously. These answers are received by a node.js application
listening inputs from Buzz controllers and pushes events to the app running on Hyperdev.</li>
<li>Application running on Hyperdev acts as a message hub and broadcaster. It relays the incoming messages to the quiz
running on Nfield and also to the Raspberry PI.</li>
<li>The quiz, running on the browser, receives these message (via our customized template) and picks the corresponding
answers selected by players.</li>
<li>As time is ticking away for each question, the customized template that&rsquo;s running the quiz emits events to the
Raspberry PI, telling it to buzz and blink harder.</li>
<li>Scores are continuously calculated as quiz progresses and in the end the winner is announced.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The code</h2>

<p>You can find all the code that powers this project in the following repository on GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/hakant/NfieldQuizGame">https://github.com/hakant/NfieldQuizGame</a></p>

<h2>Fun at the demo</h2>

<p>The most obvious (and fun!) demo for a quiz game is to find a number of volunteers from the audience and run a contest!
So that&rsquo;s what we did : )</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/demo.jpg" alt="Hackathon - Demo" /></p>

<p>&hellip; and here is a screenshot from the quiz:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/Quiz-Screenshot.png" alt="Hackathon - Nfield Quiz - Screenshot" /></p>

<p>All in all, once again, it was a great event at the NIPO Software office in Amsterdam. Who knows.. maybe in the very near future,
this little fun project can be put into actual use during various market research events. Without a doubt, it showcases the
power of Nfield and how customizable it is for variety of scenarios.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about each component and what it specifically does, read on.</p>

<h2>System Components</h2>

<br/>


<h4>Hyperdev.com / node.js</h4>

<p><a href="https://hyperdev.com">Hyperdev</a> is a prototyping environment where you can start up and develop a simple node.js application
right within the browser and see your application up and running live in a matter of seconds. Every time you save a file
in your project, hyperdev deploys it automatically in an amazing speed. It uses docker containers and AWS behind the scenes.
It also supports https out of the box, which was important for our purposes (Nfield services run on https so should any
integration or extension with it).</p>

<p>This node.js app running on hyperdev is our orchestrator. It is basically responsible with broadcasting incoming websocket
messages to all subscribers. Each piece of the puzzle (buzz controllers, raspberry pi and nfield) talk to this node app on
hyperdev instead of directly talking to each other, which btw would complicate things as each application would then have to
discover where the others are and be able to connect to them somehow.</p>

<p>In the architecture above, as long as everyone can reach hyperdev, successful communication is guaranteed.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Mac with Buzz Controllers / node.js</h4>

<p>While PlayStation buzz controllers are perfect for a quiz game, the immediate question for our little hackathon
project was; how do we connect to and control these things?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkkmz5VZoMQ">Node.js is everywhere</a>, it really is. There is a node package called
<a href="https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid">node-hid</a> which allows you to access USB Human Interface Devices (HID) from
node.js. It basically allows you to read from and write to these devices by using node buffers. We could even connect
these buzzers to Raspberry PI but we ran into a few security issues and pivoted to using a mac instead.</p>

<p>Of course, just being able to read the controller&rsquo;s input buffer doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean you know how to interpret it.
It speaks a certain protocol which you have to understand. While scratching our heads, we found this article:
<a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/article/84338/making-usb-c-friendly/">Working with USB devices in .NET and C#</a> where
the author describes the protocol clearly, well somewhat clearly:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Online_Quiz_Game/buzz-protocol.jpg" alt="PlayStation Buzz - Protocol" /></p>

<p>Long story short, each controller has a reserved space on a 6 byte area, inside which they flip bits on and off based
on the state of their buttons.</p>

<p>Here is a section of the node.js code running on the Mac that reads inputs from buzz controllers:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/7ee37ee00fccfbf487d2c6d3328f13dd.js"></script>




<br/>


<h4>Raspberry PI / node.js</h4>

<p>Since we couldn&rsquo;t succeed in reading inputs from PlayStation Buzz controllers on our Raspberry PI, we had to come up with another very useful
role for it &ndash; because we simply can&rsquo;t imagine a hackathon project without the PI (!).</p>

<p>One of our teammates said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s use it to signal remaining time at each question &ndash; with some touch of tension&rdquo;.
Then we went ahead and placed a bunch of lights on the PI and a loud buzzer. Using node.js and socket.io, it was
listening to certain type of events to start buzzing with low and high frequencies. As contestants were running out of
time while answering each question, the frequency of buzz and light effects were increasing.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Nfield Online Interviewing System / .NET, Azure</h4>

<p>Nfield Online is a data collection platform powered by NIPO Software. A SaaS platform where market research companies
can create surveys and reach their respondents. Nfield Online is bundled with a powerful domain specific
language, ODIN, created for scripting simple or complex questionnaires. Nfield also has a powerful templating system
where customers can create and run their own templates in their surveys (both for changing the look &amp; feel and behavior of
their questionnaires).</p>

<p>We used this templating system (HTML, CSS and Javascript) to tap into a running interview (in this case, our quiz) and
control it via PlayStation Buzz controllers over the internet. We also used it to send messages to the Raspberry PI
to indicate remaining time per question.</p>

<p>When this template is activated on the interview, which is running our quiz, it connects to the socket.io server
on hyperdev and starts listening to &ldquo;button pressed&rdquo; events from PlayStation Buzz controllers. When a button
is pressed it receives the event and selects the corresponding answer on the quiz for that contestant.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project and also writing about it in this blog. Every
technology company should make hackathons a part of their culture. The benefits might not be immediately clear
in the beginning but all those doubts disappear after a few events.</p>

<br/>


<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In my <a href="/blog/2016/06/01/ndc-oslo-2016/">previous post</a> I&rsquo;d talked about my plans in NDC Oslo, including<br/>
all the sessions and the 2-day workshop I was planning to attend.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a great experience. I came back with good memories and learned a few things too. NDC conferences usually
feature high quality content and good speakers, this one also lived up to the expectations.</p>

<p>I would like to share some of the highlights of the conference which, of course, are based on my perspective
and interests.</p>

<h2>Workshop: &ldquo;Microservice development&rdquo;</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/Microservices-Development-Workshop-1.jpg" alt="Microservices Development Workshop" /></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> and two employees from <a href="http://particular.net/nservicebus">Particular Software</a> ran the workshop. As it happens with all these type
of workshops, nearly half of the content was sort of a beginner to intermediate level while the other half was
covering more advanced and interesting scenarios. Here are some of my highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Services are automonous. They don&rsquo;t rely on other services to do their work. They also own their own
SLA &amp; uptime. They should have explicit boundaries and own their own data.</p></li>
<li><p>Isolation of services enable the use of different languages and frameworks per service. However, rather than using the
freedom of choosing a different language, it is more useful to have services choose their own data store. Homogenity
on the application side and heterogenity on the data side is more encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating service boundaries for actually solving business problems is a good idea. Take a good look at the
business domain and how it&rsquo;s compartmentalized within your company. Model your services around that structure. A
straightforward example of this is to create a service per business department or independent business unit.</p></li>
<li><p>We talked about messaging patterns. A lot of boilerplate code around messaging is handled for you by a product
called <a href="http://particular.net/nservicebus">NServiceBus (from Particular Software)</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using commands only within a service boundary.</li>
<li>Using events within and across service boundaries.</li>
<li>Once you separate your service into a number of granular command and event handlers, try to be as &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; as
possible inside each of these handlers &ndash; avoid using complex patterns and abstractions as much as possible
(this at least is what Jimmy is advising).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When building an SOA (service oriented architecture), the rule of thumb is that the first line public
service can call multiple downstream services to aggregate data but those services should never call other services.
Thus, the depth of services that are called are never more than one. This principle will help you avoid
complexity and possible high latency.</p></li>
<li><p>For this reason above (downstream services don&rsquo;t call other services) an example in the workshop used a
technique where a service codebase contains public interfaces which can be implemented by other services and shared
during development time (as nuget packages). <a href="https://github.com/Particular/Workshop/tree/master/exercises/src/04%20Integration/after/Divergent.ITOps.Interfaces">Check this code</a>
for an example of this use case.</p>

<ul>
<li>As an example, if sales domain needs to get something from customer domain, sales service
declares an interface and customer service supplies the implementation to that service.</li>
<li>This means that one service doesn&rsquo;t call the other one at runtime but instead runs that piece of code directly.</li>
<li>Note that this removes the runtime dependency but introduces development time dependency. If you&rsquo;re doing
microservices mostly for reasons around team composition and independence, this might sound less attractive to
you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You can find all workshop exercises <a href="https://github.com/Particular/Workshop">here on GitHub</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conference Highlights</h2>

<br/>


<h3>Erlang is cool, so is functional programming!</h3>

<p>Functional programming was a large and popular track in NDC Oslo. Created a lot of buzz for sure. This photo
below was taken at the end of conference day 1. I believe at the end of the conference <em>#fsharp</em>, <em>#erlang</em>, <em>#phoenix</em>
and <em>#elixir</em> were all sitting high in this top 10 list as some of the most spoken technologies.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/NDC-Oslo-Twitter-Buzz.png" alt="NDC Oslo Twitter Buzz" /></p>

<p>I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Erlang</a> for the first time and found it
quite interesting. In Wikipedia, Erlang is described as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language. It is also a garbage-collected runtime system.
Erlang is known for its designs that are well suited for systems with the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distributed</li>
<li>Fault-tolerant</li>
<li>Soft real-time</li>
<li>Highly available, non-stop applications</li>
<li>Hot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Do any of these sound familiar? Welcome to the cutting edge stateful microservices technology, from 1986!</p>

<p>Lightweight processes are the main building blocks of an Erlang application:</p>

<blockquote><p>Processes are the primary means to structure an Erlang application. They are neither operating system processes
nor operating system threads, but lightweight processes that are scheduled by Erlang&rsquo;s BEAM VM.</p></blockquote>

<p>Based on my first impressions I found many conceptual similarities between Erlang and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/">Service Fabric</a>: the idea of
stateful and stateless services messaging each other. Erlang doesn&rsquo;t have the concept of replicas (unlike Service Fabric),
all process nodes are peers &ndash; no primary &amp; secondary relationship. Which means if a process crashes the state is
gone. Of course there are solutions to this &ndash; like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnesia">Mnesia</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My gut feeling after learning more about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/erlang?src=hash">#erlang</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ndcoslo?src=hash">#ndcoslo</a> : <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/servicefabric?src=hash">#servicefabric</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/erlang?src=hash">#erlang</a> plus some (large) churn.I still love <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csharp?src=hash">#csharp</a> though</p>&mdash; Hakan Tuncer (@hakant) <a href="https://twitter.com/hakant/status/741296386856095744">June 10, 2016</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be looking into Erlang, <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> and
<a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> because I&rsquo;m sold to the idea that these things are pretty powerful to ignore.</p>

<br/>


<h3>Head to head session with questions from Stack Overflow</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/head-to-head.jpg" alt="Head to head with Scott and Jimmy" /></p>

<p>Both <a href="https://twitter.com/odetocode">Scott Allen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> are proponents of testing with less mocking. Jimmy said he doesn&rsquo;t like
using in memory database tricks or any other unrealistic testing styles. A few tricks that he spoke of were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using database transactions without commiting in the end &ndash; to get back to a reset state after each test.</li>
<li>Using a nuget package called <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/Respawn">Respawn</a> that can cleanup the
database after each test in a clever way.</li>
<li>Using real storage during tests has been beneficial to these guys according to them (less unforeseen bugs).</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<h3>.NET Core is shaping up nicely</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/After_NDCOslo2016/dot-net-core.jpg" alt=".NET Core - Mark Rendle" /></p>

<p>ASP.NET Core looks beautiful even though the roadmap had its fair share of ups and downs for a long period. The
talk about making the Kestrel web server performant is fantastic. It turns out that creating a very performant web
server takes ridiculous amount of code optimizations. Must watch. Actually most .NET Core talks were very
interesting.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time for NDC Oslo again &ndash; happening between 6-10 June 2016. I&rsquo;m excited to be going there once again
this year.</p>

<p>First two days I&rsquo;ll be taking a workshop on the topic of <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/workshop/microservice-development-with-examples-in-nservicebus/">microservice development (with examples in NServiceBus)</a>.
Originally the speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/UdiDahan">Udi Dahan</a> but today I saw that for
personal reasons Udi is not going to make it to the conference anymore. Instead, now <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a>
is going to give the workshop and I&rsquo;m still up for it! I&rsquo;m hoping to learn more than a few good practices and ideas
around building maintainable and resilient service oriented architectures.</p>

<p>After the workshop 3 day long conference goodness starts. I&rsquo;ve been looking at the agenda for a while and marking
the sessions that I&rsquo;m interested in. I&rsquo;ve put my list below. My plan is to attend the first session
in each slot and see if I can watch the rest via recordings after the conference.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to be at NDC Oslo next week and don&rsquo;t mind talking to strangers <a href="https://twitter.com/hakant">send me a tweet</a>!
Always nice to have a few drinks and meet new folks.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I think most professionals who design product interfaces (both physical or software interfaces) will agree
that simplicity and discoverability of an interface is a big winning factor. Simple and discoverable
interfaces are usually self explanatory and for this very reason they tend to provide great user
experiences.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should stop providing documentation or user manuals for our
products. A discoverable user interface with a clean, easily accessible documentation is I think what
every product deserves.</p>

<p>When it comes to user manuals or guides, I&rsquo;m so much in favor of a user manual that&rsquo;s deeply connected or
embedded to the user interface rather than a pile of content parked somewhere completely disconnected from
the actual product.</p>

<p>UI embedded manuals can be designed in many ways, one of which is through a concept called &ldquo;App Walkthrough&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>App Walkthrough</h2>

<p>From a conceptual point of view I knew what an app walkthrough is for a very long time but before I sat down
to write this post I was tempted to call it &ldquo;in-app tutorials&rdquo;. After some searching around the topic, I
discovered that it actually has a <a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/ux-flows-how-when-to-design-app-walkthrough">common name</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A walkthrough is the process of intentionally revealing functionality to a user.</p></blockquote>

<p>Implementing a successful app walkthrough is <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-instructional-overlay/">not an easy endeavour at all</a>.
It&rsquo;s like a double edged sword. If you <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/07/how-to-design-a-successful-web-app-walkthrough/">get it right</a>
it&rsquo;s all unicorns and butterflies. If you get it wrong you can do more harm than good.</p>

<h2>Implementing one for Hackathon Planner</h2>

<p>A couple of days ago I started flirting with the idea of implementing a walkthough for the <a href="https://github.com/hakant/HackathonPlanner">Hackathon
Planner</a>. This is what came out:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/App_Walkthrough/Hackathon-Planner-Walkthrough.gif" alt="Hackathon Planner Walkthrough" /></p>

<p>You can try it by visiting the <a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">Hackathon Planner preview website</a>.
It is designed to be viewed only once and then gets out of the way forever. There are two things that I still
want to add to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A quick opt out button on each individual step of the walkthough so that users have an easy way to exit
the tutorial without being forced to complete it.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><strong>Update:</strong> Right after I wrote this blog post, I came across a tutorial that&rsquo;s built into GitHub Desktop (for
Mac). See the screenshot below. Clicking &ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; takes the user to the next step of the tutorial while
clicking the close button on the top left corner stops the tutorial. It&rsquo;s brilliant.
<br/><br/>
<img src="/assets/App_Walkthrough/GitHub_Desktop_Walkthrough.png" alt="GitHub Desktop Walkthrough" /></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>An overlay that makes the UI frozen while the tooltips are running. If a user doesn&rsquo;t follow the
tooltip popovers and starts clicking around, things get messy (and this is bound to happen if I
know anything about users).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Show me the code</h2>

<p>Inside the Aurelia app, I&rsquo;ve created a component called &ldquo;<em>TooltipService</em>&rdquo; which is responsible for
orchestrating the walkthrough. There&rsquo;s also a separate data holder class &ldquo;<em>Tooltips</em>&rdquo; that declaratively defines all walkthrough
steps and their contents, positions etc.</p>

<p>Tooltips are created using the <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/popovers/">popover component from Bootstrap 4</a>
(still in alpha at the time of this writing).</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>~2 months ago <a href="/blog/2016/01/30/hackathon-planner-for-nipo-software/">I wrote about Hackathon Planner</a>
and hustled the idea as a candidate project for the next hackathon at NIPO Software. Then the hackathon day arrived.
We formed a team of 6 and spent a day working on it. Rutger shot a time lapse video from that day.</p>

<br/>




<iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMK8vvJm87A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Since then, I continue working on the Hackathon Planner whenever I find some free time here and there. Rutger also
occasionally shows up in the commit history contributing with his CSS superpowers.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> everyday at work and this time I want to experiement with
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. I&rsquo;ve put up an <a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">early preview of Hackathon Planner</a>
on Amazon S3. I&rsquo;ll keep updating it from this point on. At the time of this writing, it&rsquo;s only a client
side preview &ndash; actions are only saved on the local storage of the browser. Not very useful yet but it soon will be.
<a href="http://hackathonplanner.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/">Check it out.</a></p>

<h2>Aurelia</h2>

<p><a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia</a> has been my framework of choice for this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single page application</a>. It truly is a great framework in
the sense that it really gets out of your way. After I learned some of the fundamentals of Aurelia, I was basically
good to go. Some periods I even forgot that I was using a framework because it is simply not in your face. Let me
show you some code samples from the project.</p>

<br/>


<h4>ES6 and ES7 in action</h4>

<p>Aurelia takes advantage of the latest javascript standards as much as possible. Take a look at this &ldquo;nav-bar&rdquo;
component from the Hackathon Planner.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/27562e37df6d7bf59f24fd12b316045a.js"></script>


<ul>
<li>First three lines are an example of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import">ES6 module importing</a>.
This is how a javascript module can make use of code from external libraries.</li>
<li>Line #5 is an example of an <a href="https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841#.5obmn2df6">ES7 Decorator</a> that is in this case
<a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/aurelia-update-with-decorators-ie9-and-more/">used by Aurelia for dependency injection</a>.
Basically we&rsquo;re telling Aurelia to pass those components as constructor arguments to the NavBar component.</li>
<li>And the rest of the code is the NavBar class that is written based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class specification</a>.
See how clean this component is &ndash; it&rsquo;s pure javascript.</li>
</ul>


<br/>  


<h4>Dynamic application root</h4>

<p>Code below is the entry point to the Hackathon Planner: &ldquo;main.js&rdquo;.</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/8c94080e4c61ea04bfaf1a009dbcc25b.js"></script>


<ul>
<li>Line #2 imports a custom authentication service that I wrote and it gets resolved as a singleton instance at line #13.
In Aurelia all dependencies are registered as singleton by default (unless you specify it otherwise).</li>
<li>Based on the authentication status (line #14) aurelia app root is set either to the app or to the login
component. The ability to set arbitrary application roots is a powerful feature of Aurelia that enables some
<a href="http://patrickwalters.net/creating-multipage-apps-using-aurelia-2/">interesting scenarios</a>.</li>
<li>I borrowed this idea from <a href="http://davismj.me/blog/aurelia-auth-pt2/">Matthew James Davis</a>.</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<h4>Validation</h4>

<p>Aurelia also comes with a <a href="https://github.com/aurelia/validation">validation plugin</a> and <a href="http://blog.durandal.io/2016/03/23/aurelia-babel-6-and-jspm-update/">it&rsquo;s currently undergoing some big refactoring</a>.
It still wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to show how it looks like at the moment. Note that the @ensure decorator is recently
deprecated (which means I&rsquo;ll also need to adapt this code going forward).</p>

<p>This is a stripped down version of the project class in Hackathon Planner:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/69363eaf32e2052d2d2697335704555e.js"></script>


<ul>
<li>Line #8 and #10 sets validation rules on those properties and line #20 initializes the validation for this
object.</li>
</ul>


<p>And this event handler in &ldquo;new-card.js&rdquo; validates a project before adding or updating it:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/bbb87af2f2306724bbd1981973b8d83f.js"></script>


<br/>


<h4>Beautiful components</h4>

<p>In Aurelia, user interface components are composed of <a href="http://aurelia.io/docs.html#/aurelia/framework/1.0.0-beta.1.1.4/doc/article/creating-components">view and view-model pairs</a>.
These two are created by Aurelia&rsquo;s dependency injection framework and gets linked to each other via data binding.</p>

<p>Here is one of those pairs from the Hackathon Planner. This is how the overview page is rendered:</p>

<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/6ab1a376f50b80bd115f765e16a551f4.js"></script>




<br/>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/hakant/7296309c6a7166254ac701a6b27caf47.js"></script>


<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Notice how a component is required into a template at line #2.</li>
<li>And then all projects are looped through and each one is rendered into another component called &ldquo;idea-card&rdquo;
at line #5.</li>
</ul>
