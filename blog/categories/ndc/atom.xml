    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes! It&rsquo;s happening. We will be at <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/" target="_blank">NDC Oslo 2014</a> with 3 developers from <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/bjorn_coltof" target="_blank">Bjorn Coltof</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/serifozcan" target="_blank">Serif Ozcan</a> and I are going to be there between 2-6th of June. We&rsquo;ll be attending the conference as well as the pre-conference workshops. We&rsquo;re all pretty excited and it&rsquo;s going to be awesome. Connect with us if you&rsquo;re also going to be there! We can have a chat over a beer or two. All beers are on NIPO Software! (just testing if Jeroen Noordman, our CEO, is reading this post. I should soon find out).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the conference content. The sessions are so great that you wish you could have mitosis and attend at least a couple of them at the same time. But again life is all about priorities. Clarifying the priorities is tough.</p>

<p>My thought process involved asking myself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I particularly interested in the main subject of this session? (Doh!)</li>
<li>Is this session content something I can find in books, online documents or Pluralsight courses? How original is it?</li>
<li>..and of course it&rsquo;s preferable that I can apply this knowledge somewhere in the office like on <a href="http://nfieldmr.com/get-started.aspx" target="_blank">Nfield</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a bunch of <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/pre-conference-workshops" target="_blank">pre-conference workshops</a> that will take place in the first 2 days, right before the conference starts. First choice had to be made here. This is something you can&rsquo;t change afterwards. It&rsquo;s printed on the ticket.</p>

<p>In the end Bjorn and I picked <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/pre-conference-workshop/identity-workshop/1750" target="_blank">Identity and access control for modern web applications and APIs (Dominick Baier &ndash; Brock Allen)</a> and Serif chose to stay away from us by enrolling in <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/pre-conference-workshop/angularjs-workshop/1865" target="_blank">AngularJS workshop (Scott Allen)</a>. Can&rsquo;t really blame him, I love Scott Allen&rsquo;s <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/scott-allen" target="_blank">Pluralsight courses.</a></p>

<p>The most tricky part in this selection is that all &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; single day workshops are set for 3rd of June. So it becomes very hard to pick two separate single day workshops. This also goes as a feedback to NDC organizers. Don&rsquo;t do that again!</p>

<p>After we hack enough code during these 2 day workshops the actual conference will start. Here are screenshots from the agenda together with my selections based on priority. I&rsquo;ve color coded the talks on the calender:</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">Highest priority.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Middle priority. Go to this one if you can&rsquo;t somehow make the one above.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:green">Low priority. Go to this one if you can&rsquo;t make neither of above.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This is obviously A LOT OF new stuff. Here is the list of technologies I should get myself familiar with to avoid showing up clueless in the sessions:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Probably more posts will follow during and after the conference.</p>
