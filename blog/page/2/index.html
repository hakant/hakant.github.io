		<p>Every now and then I read about rich people talking about the correlation between money, happiness and self fulfillment. More often than not, it&rsquo;s the lack of correlation that they talk about.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that one has to have access to a certain level of income to satisfy the layers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">hierarchy of needs</a>.
On the other hand it&rsquo;s a well known idea &amp; <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-day-i-became-a-millionaire-55d7dc4d8293#.7894yhemj">experience</a> that more money has diminishing returns on happiness:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hanging out in ibiza with a bunch of friends and partying with famous people, able to do whatever I want, and I&#39;ve never felt more isolated.</p>&mdash; Markus Persson (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/637563038258868224">August 29, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I&rsquo;ve started reading this book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-ebook/dp/B00GO8HZIW">Flow: The Psychology of Happiness</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>. It starts with a simple claim:</p>

<blockquote><p>We humans have a built-in dissatisfaction with what we have and what we own. Material world does not make us happy. Unless we can moderate this dissatisfaction and start enjoying the moment we&rsquo;ll be disappointed.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has always made perfect sense to me. Materials by themselves aren&rsquo;t worth anything. At the end of the day it all comes down to what we do with them, or most importantly, what we actually do with our lives.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another excerpt from a WSJ article <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/can-money-buy-happiness-heres-what-science-has-to-say-1415569538">&ldquo;Can Money Buy You Happiness?&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In short, this latest research suggests, wealth alone doesn’t provide any guarantee of a good life. What matters a lot more than a big income is how people spend it. For instance, giving money away makes people a lot happier than lavishing it on themselves. And when they do spend money on themselves, people are a lot happier when they use it for experiences like travel than for material goods.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Enter Flow</h2>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been discovering that flow is one of the sources of happiness in life (maybe the most powerful one!). It is also a very rewarding state to be in. Pleasure is also a source of happiness, but unlike pleasure, the enjoyment that comes with flow leads to growth and higher levels of complexity.</p>

<p>Flow is defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">Wikipedia</a> as:</p>

<blockquote><p>In positive psychology, flow, also known as the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does.</p></blockquote>

<h2>8 Major Conditions of Flow</h2>

<p>In his book, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes the 8 components of flow-like activities. Know these conditions and try to apply them to what you do everyday.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Clear Goals.</strong> Knowing what we have to do very clearly. Not only the big goal, but also each step of these activities should be well defined. Playing chess, tennis or a musical instrument naturally falls into these type of activities, but with a bit of conscious effort we can apply this idea to many day to day activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong> Immediate Feedback.</strong> Knowing how well we are doing. Getting clear and constant flow of feedback. Not having this type of feedback makes it easier to get distracted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges of the activities are met with the right level of skills of the person.</strong> What needs to be done is in balance with what we can do. When a job is hard, demanding or very easy we can get stressed or distracted. If it&rsquo;s a match, then it becomes enjoyable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feeling a focus and concentration on what you&rsquo;re doing.</strong> In flow, the split attention (that we usually have) focuses into a single beam of attention. Here we can achieve so much more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Everyday&rsquo;s frustrations are gone.</strong> During flow, we don&rsquo;t worry about anything anymore because our mind is not wandering &ndash; no future, nor past. It&rsquo;s a form of escape from the real world and creating different realities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You feel that you can be in control of your life, your actions, your experience.</strong> The sense of control is a great feeling, it&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t feel during our everyday lives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loose a sense of subconsciousness &ndash; the ego defense.</strong> We usually worry about how other people think of us. It&rsquo;s a feeling of self-monitoring, a state of defensiveness, a frequent questioning of how we look and so on. During flow we go beyond ego (transcendence). One of the paradoxes of flow is that during the experience we forget about ourselves but after the experience we come back stronger, because we know that we&rsquo;ve accomplished something and that makes a positive impact on our self confidence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sense of time seems to be transformed.</strong> During flow, sometimes hours get condensed into minutes. Sometimes a couple of seconds feel like minutes, because so much is packed in the moment (for physical activities). Time adopts itself to your activities rather than the other way around. Rather than you boxing your life into time, you can change the time.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Flow vs Agile teams &amp; Open Offices</h2>

<p>Programming is a great flow-like activity. It also naturally fits all conditions above, and yet the agile movement and the open-office model has started an open season on flow: <strong>kill on sight!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done a <a href="https://www.google.nl/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=open+offices+productivity">google search on &ldquo;open office productivity&rdquo;</a> and it seems like in the last few years it has attracted a lot of negative criticism. Some examples are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/30/google-got-it-wrong-the-open-office-trend-is-destroying-the-workplace/">&ldquo;The open-office trend is destroying the workplace&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/open-office-backlash-seeking-productivity-in-a-noisy-world/">&ldquo;Open-Office Backlash: Seeking Productivity in a Noisy World&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/currency-tag/the-open-office-trap">&ldquo;The open-office trap&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much consensus around the topic. Facebook is the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/08/25/facebook-unveils-new-campus-will-workers-be-sick-stressed-and-dissatisfied/#f08022b13351">biggest fan of the open-office model</a> while Stack Overflow made it clear that <a href="https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/why-we-still-believe-in-private-offices/">they still believe in private offices</a>. It also appears that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140911-open-office-victims-push-back">Microsoft is still pushing back the open-office trend</a> by saying: &ldquo;Too much togetherness can sap productivity and creativity&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Does flow matter to you? And how do you like to work within your team?</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><a href="/blog/2015/05/02/devintersection-and-anglebrackets-in-phoenix/">I was at DevIntersection Conference</a> in Phoenix around mid May 2015. Apart from the regular conference schedule, I took a few interesting workshops one of which was &ldquo;Zen of Architecture&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/741">Juval Lowy</a>.</p>

<p>As the name clearly implies one day workshop was all about software architecture and the ways to approach it. Juval talked about a method that he uses for decomposing systems and making design decisions.</p>

<p>It was a full day of content storm with as little breaks in between as possible (this is the Juval style I suppose). I&rsquo;ve been reviewing my notes and presentation slides thinking this can become a book if I try to write everything. So instead, this post focuses on a certain part of the workshop which I think covers the core idea.</p>

<h2>The Method</h2>

<p>Juval introduces a method which he calls &ldquo;The Method&rdquo; for decomposing a system. Achieving the right decomposition of a system is one of the most important things in software architecture. The end result of your decomposition is your architecture.</p>

<blockquote><p>For the beginner architect, there are many options<br/>
For the master architect, there are only a few</p></blockquote>

<h2>Functional Decomposition</h2>

<p>The biggest sin of any software architect. Never ever do functional decomposition!</p>

<br/>


<h4>What is it?</h4>

<ul>
<li>This is also known as the flow-chart decomposition.</li>
<li>Basing services and system components on the order of logical steps in use cases.</li>
<li>Decomposing the system based on features, functional requirements and time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Juval emotionally talks about &ldquo;functional decomposition&rdquo; easily for more than an hour. Can&rsquo;t repeat enough how bad it is and how we&rsquo;re all guilty of doing it from time to time and why we should be very conscious about resisting our bad habits. Say &ldquo;functional decomposition&rdquo; to Juval one more time and he&rsquo;ll kill you right there without blinking.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Why is it so bad?</h4>

<ul>
<li>It leads to duplicating behaviors across services.</li>
<li>It leads to explosion and bloating of services and intricate relationships inside and between them.</li>
<li>It couples multiple services to data contract.</li>
<li>Promotes implementing use cases in higher level terms thus difficult to reuse same behavior in another use case.</li>
<li>Couples services to order and current use cases.</li>
<li>Prevents single point of entry.</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<h4>Example of Functional Decomposition</h4>

<p>Here are  a few slides from the workshop that shows Functional Decomposition in action.</p>

<h2>Volatility-Based Decomposition</h2>

<p>If you would learn one thing from this entire course this should be it, Juval mentioned repeatedly. <strong>You should always decompose a system based on volatility.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Identify areas of potential change and encapsulate them in services.</li>
<li>Look for functional potential changes but <strong>not domain functional</strong>. Meaning that while looking for volatility, don&rsquo;t speculate on potential changes to the nature of the business. Don&rsquo;t overdo it.</li>
<li>Implement behavior as interactions between services or subsystems.</li>
<li>Create your milestones based on integration of these services not features.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is the universal principle of good design says Juval. Encapsulate change to insulate. Do not resonate with change. Functional decomposition on the other hand maximizes the impact of change because it&rsquo;s coupled to it.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Challenges with Volatility-Based Decomposition</h4>

<p>There are challenges in creating a Volatility-Based Decomposition. First of all it usually takes longer than functional because volatility is not often self evident. On the other hand features are kept thrown at your face. People around you are feature thirsty, they&rsquo;ll keep asking for their features. You should instead fight the insanity and focus on the bigger picture and volatilities. Getting the management support is usually another challenge. Juval said architects should be responsible, fight against these opposing forces and do what is right.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Axes of volatility</h4>

<p>There are two axes of volatility.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the same customer over time</li>
<li>At the same time across customers</li>
</ul>


<p>These axes should be independent from each other. So encapsulate them from each other as well. When they&rsquo;re not independent it&rsquo;s a sign of functional decomposition.</p>

<p>Prior to architecture and decomposition, as part of requirements gathering and analysis, prepare a list of areas of volatility. Ask what could change along the axes of volatility.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Example of Volatility-Based Decomposition</h4>

<p>Below, you&rsquo;ll find 5 slides from the workshop that brainstorms on possible volatilities of a trading system. Here are some guidelines for capturing volatility:</p>

<ul>
<li>The objective is to have a mindset of &ldquo;what could possibly change?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Capturing the areas of volatility earlier is better than later. The later you figure it out the more it will cost you.</li>
<li>Once settled on the ares of volatility encapsulate them in components of architecture.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need an exhaustive list. This is a process of diminishing returns. Don&rsquo;t overdo it.</li>
<li>Some volatile areas may relate too much to the nature of your business. This type of volatility is out of your scope.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2026.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2027.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2028.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2029.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2030.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2032.jpg" style="border: solid;"></p>

<br/>


<h4>Let&rsquo;s analyze this decomposition.</h4>

<p>Transition from list of areas of volatility to services is hardly ever pure 1:1. Sometimes a single service encapsulates multiple areas. Some areas may map to an operational concept or may be encapsulated in a third party component.</p>

<p>Always encapsulate the data storage volatility behind data access services. Encapsulate where the storage is, what technology is used to access it and refer your storage as storage, not as database or whatever the actual technology is.</p>

<p>Following 3 slides do further analysis of the decomposition in this example. Please refer to the diagram above as you read the key points:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2034.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2035.jpg" style="border: solid;">
<img src="/assets/Zen_of_Architecture/IMG_2036.jpg" style="border: solid;"></p>

<h2>Decomposition and Business</h2>

<p>Avoid encapsulating changes to the nature of your business. Because</p>

<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll need it very rarely</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll be diving into speculation and speculation based design trap</li>
<li>when you do it you&rsquo;ll probably do it very poorly because there are too many unknowns (and again speculations)</li>
</ul>


<p>While designing a system for your business don&rsquo;t only focus on your own also keep your competitor in mind. Design both for you and your competitor. This is a useful posture in designing systems and it&rsquo;s not about features or functionality but it&rsquo;s about understanding the nature of the business. Keeping your competitors in mind and not only focusing on your own business will help you understand the nature of the business even better. This way you can have a better judgement about what is volatile and what is not.</p>

<h2>Decomposition and Longevity</h2>

<p>Volatility is very closely tied to longevity. The longer things do not change the longer they have till they do change or are replaced. The more frequently things change the more likely they would change in the future.</p>

<p>You must take into account impact from change regardless of your requirements. Ask yourself what has changed over the past 5-7 years and what will change in the next 5-7 years. Encapsulate things that would change within the life of your system.</p>

<h2>Further topics</h2>

<p>For the rest of the day Juval dived into</p>

<ul>
<li>layered architectures</li>
<li>typical layers</li>
<li>definition of managers, engines, resource access services and differences between them</li>
<li>open and closed architectures</li>
<li>what not to do when using &ldquo;the method&rdquo;</li>
<li>creating call graphs within system components and observing/revealing anti-patterns</li>
<li>a bonus section called &ldquo;what about agile?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all it was a mind tickling workshop and I hope I could give you more than only a taste. I may write other posts about the bullet points above if/when I find the time.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>Hakan</p>

<p>Norwegian Developers Conference (NDC) is I think one of the best and I&rsquo;d really enjoyed it last year. But change is good.</p>

<p>Following a deep consideration I reckon that I can&rsquo;t go to Norway again&hellip; Not after all those shrimps I had to sit face to face in Oslo (see OsloFjord Cruises). My friend Bjorn is very disciplined about reminding that to me consistently.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s going to happen there</h2>

<p>DevIntersection has a number of tracks which are called &ldquo;intersections&rdquo;:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/AngleBrackets_DevIntersection/devintersection_tracks.png" alt="DevIntersection Tracks" /></p>

<p>ASP.NET, Visual Studio and Azure intersections are grouped together since they&rsquo;re highly related to each other. This group of tracks will be my main interest in Phoenix together with the bonus open web event: <a href="https://anglebrackets.org/">anglebrackets</a>.</p>

<p>An exciting aspect of DevIntersection 2015 is that it&rsquo;s the first conference after <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015">Build 2015</a> at which Microsoft made <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/29/everything-that-happened-at-the-2015-microsoft-build-developer-conference/">a number of big announcements</a>. There&rsquo;s a more detailed list and link aggregation about Build 2015 <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/2015/04/30/the-morning-brew-1851/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/2015/05/01/the-morning-brew-1852/">here</a> which I highly recommend.</p>

<p>Here is a piece from the official event site:</p>

<blockquote><p>We invite you to the most dynamic developer event in our industry at the next DEVintersection, May 2015. This event is POST BUILD and IGNITE which will allow our presenters to go deep into the new releases and technologies announced. We will focus on Visual Studio, ASP.net, HTML5, Microsoft Azure, XAML, ALM, Architecture, Design and in the bonus co-located open web event anglebrackets we feature Angular JS, HTML5, CSS, Java Script, SPA, SEO, Speech enabled Mobile Apps, Design and much more.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be attending three workshops. Two of them are before the conference and last one is after the conference on Friday. Each workshop is a day long.</p>

<h2><img src="/assets/AngleBrackets_DevIntersection/DevIntersection%20Workshops_2.png" alt="DevIntersection Tracks" /></h2>

<p>And for the conference itself, I&rsquo;ve looked at the schedule and marked the sessions I&rsquo;m interested in so far. For a number of slots I&rsquo;ve picked more than one session for now &ndash; I&rsquo;ll have to pick one of them on the spot.</p>

<h2><img src="/assets/AngleBrackets_DevIntersection/DevIntersection_Schedule_Tuesday.png" alt="DevIntersection Tracks" /></h2>

<h2><img src="/assets/AngleBrackets_DevIntersection/DevIntersection_Schedule_Wednesday.png" alt="DevIntersection Tracks" /></h2>

<p><img src="/assets/AngleBrackets_DevIntersection/DevIntersection_Schedule_Thursday.png" alt="DevIntersection Tracks" /></p>

<p>As usual I&rsquo;ll be sharing my experiences from the event on twitter and facebook. You can follow me on twitter using <a href="https://twitter.com/hakant">@hakant</a>. And in case you&rsquo;re reading this and also going to DevIntersection in May let&rsquo;s connect and meet there!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2015/03/12/finalization-and-disposition-in-net/" itemprop="url">Notes on Finalization and Disposition in .NET</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Have you ever thought why disposition pattern is designed the way it is? I hadn&rsquo;t. Sometimes we learn things along the way and never question its basics or roots again. We do it that way because we&rsquo;re told so or because it just worked so far and we never looked back.</p>

<p>Nicole Calinoiu&rsquo;s talk from NDC Oslo taught me many things one of which is how IDisposable pattern is designed and became the way it is. It&rsquo;s an awesome talk, one that I can strongly recommend. I&rsquo;ve embedded the video at the bottom of this page, make sure to check it out.</p>

<p>I saw the talk twice and wanted to take notes for myself. Notes that I can revisit when the details get blurry in my head six months or a year down the path. I&rsquo;ve also double checked or dived into some other details through MSDN and included those in the notes as well.</p>

<h2>Finalization</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Never ever set any object to NULL to &ldquo;help&rdquo; Garbage Collector do his job. You&rsquo;re not helping him and even making things worse.</p></li>
<li><p>Although .NET Runtime knows about cleaning up memory really well, it can&rsquo;t possibly know the shared resources (file system, network connections, registery etc&hellip;) that your objects are using. Finalization is the object&rsquo;s opportunity to cleanup those resources when it&rsquo;s about to be removed from the memory.</p></li>
<li><p>If a .NET object overrides the method Object.Finalize(), the Garbage Collector will call the Finalize method before cleaning up the object from memory.</p></li>
<li><p>If the object does not override the method Finalize, Garbage Collector doesn&rsquo;t finalize the object (obviously). Here is what <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.finalize%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN</a> says:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>The garbage collector does not mark types derived from Object for finalization unless they override the Finalize method.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Now comes the part that&rsquo;s obscure in the MSDN documentation. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.finalize%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN</a> says (emphasis mine):</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>You should override Finalize for a class that uses <strong>unmanaged resources</strong> such as file handles or database connections that must be released when the managed object that uses them is discarded during garbage collection.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unmanaged resources</strong> mentioned in the documentation are <strong>NOT</strong> the managed wrappers. If you have code that directly uses IntPtr and DllImport then you&rsquo;re using unmanaged resources and you need to be thinking about Finalization.</p></li>
<li><p>Managed wrappers have their own Finalizers (hopefully) so it&rsquo;s not your responsibility to supply another Finalizer on top of that. But if you have any code in a class that looks like the one below, then you need a Finalizer for that specific class.</p></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing an <strong>unnecessary</strong> Finalizer comes with a cost: delaying the cleanup process of your objects. Finalization brings extra steps to the cleaning process (adding those objects to Finalization queue and running their Finalization logic in a separate thread) which delay freeing up memory for those objects. So beware.</p></li>
<li><p>Finalizers should not access any managed resources. Any managed resource at that point could already be harvested by garbage collector. So basically none of the managed objects can be trusted to exist. Finalizers should only cleanup the unmanaged resources and return.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Disposition</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Finalization happens when the Garbage Collector &ldquo;feels like it&rdquo;. In general you don&rsquo;t have (and shouldn&rsquo;t take) any control on when the GC is running or not. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to cleanup and let go of those shared resources when they&rsquo;re not needed anymore? Hell yeah. It would be terrible to keep locking a file and wait until GC comes to clean it up. This is exactly why Disposition exists.</p></li>
<li><p>When a class implements IDisposable it is basically declaring that it needs to be cleaned up. Whenever you&rsquo;re done with an IDisposable class and you know you&rsquo;re the <strong>only</strong> one using it or the <strong>owner</strong> of its lifecycle, you need to call its Dispose method to clean it up.</p></li>
<li><p>While Disposing a class and releasing its shared resources, we also want to call Finalize if our class is Finalizable. If you try to do that though, compiler gives an error message: &ldquo;Destructors and Finalize can not be called directly&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s why there is a pattern called IDisposable pattern.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">MSDN documentation on IDisposable interface</a> includes a C# code sample showing how the pattern should be implemented. Notice that because Finalize can not be called directly, another Dispose method is introduced that takes a boolean argument which determines whether the class is being disposed or finalized.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s look at a few important aspects of this implementation:

<ul>
<li>Class keeps track of whether it has been disposed or not and prevents being disposed more than once.</li>
<li>When a class is being Disposed, the Finalization logic also runs. So it tells the Garbage Collector not to bother Finalizing this object anymore (performance gain):</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='csharp'><div class='line'><span class="n">GC</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SuppressFinalize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>These days writing a Finalizer is fairly uncommon. Most .NET applications doesn&rsquo;t require a usage of direct pointer to an unmanaged resource. On top of that, now there is a class called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.safehandle%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" target="_blank">SafeHandle</a> which automatically wraps a pointer to an unmanaged resource. It also handles finalization for you. So this means writing a Finalizer now is very very uncommon. Check the article from Joe Duffy all the way back from 2005: <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2005/12/27/never-write-a-finalizer-again-well-almost-never/" target="_blank">Never write a finalizer again (well, almost never)</a></p></li>
<li><p>The whole purpose of IDisposable pattern is to accomodate Finalization and Disposition under a single solution. But because you may never ever write a finalizer again, the whole IDisposable pattern ends up being designed to cover a very very corner case. And it&rsquo;s unfortunate that nothing has changed since 2005&hellip;</p></li>
</ul>

	</div>
	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2014/12/08/kiwi-updates-and-first-demo/" itemprop="url">Kiwi - Updates & First Demo</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a month since I first wrote about Kiwi. <a href="/blog/2014/11/01/building-kiwi/">In that post</a> I had a &ldquo;demo&rdquo; section where I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was planning to create a screencast to demonstrate how Kiwi works and what it does but didn&rsquo;t get around doing it as part of this blog post. That&rsquo;s high on my to-do list. Another post will be on its way soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the last month a lot has happened. Therefore I had to postpone the demo for a bit longer than I thought. We even had to re-evaluate one of the most essential parts of our software after realizing that our first strategy had some weaknesses that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fix simply because they were outside of our control. So what do you do when a problem is outside of your control? You find another path and bypass it. At least that&rsquo;s what we did but more on that after the demo.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>So first things first. Here is a ~6 minute demo below. Also read on if you&rsquo;re interested in the things that kept us busy in this period.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/S1QcnZmyNpA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>TripleS vs NIPO format</h2>

<p>When we started implementing Kiwi we thought that we could take TripleS files in order to determine the variables in a questionnaire. It was all good, a TripleS file indeed represents the structure of the questionnaire and the variables in it. But we also thought we could always parse the original NIPO data with it, without converting the data to the TripleS format before each data transfer.</p>

<p>It turned out that this assumption was wrong. Later we&rsquo;ve found out a few scenarios where it was simply impossible to predict the structure of the original data file by looking at the TripleS questionnaire structure alone. F.ex. questionnaires with jumps in the data positions or GOTO statements were resulting in undesired shifts in the variable references.</p>

<p>Being able to transfer data multiple times using the original NIPO data (without using any sort of conversion) is one of our design goals. This design will also enable us to completely automate this process where the user sets up the survey once and then Kiwi does the transfer continuously in the background while also displaying some sort of a dashboard to enable <strong>live visualization</strong> of the data collected during the survey.</p>

<h2>Supporting the VAR format</h2>

<p>To realise this design goal we&rsquo;ve decided to add support for VAR file format. VAR file is similar to TripleS file in the sense that they both represent the structure of a questionnaire and list all the variables in a questionnaire. But unlike the TripleS format, the VAR format doesn&rsquo;t require the data to be converted. VAR file represents the original NIPO data. That&rsquo;s exactly what we want.</p>

<p>So now when defining surveys, Kiwi accepts both TripleS and VAR file formats. If TripleS format is used the data also needs to be converted to TripleS. For a NIPO Software client I assume this will almost never be the preferred way. The most effective way will be to use the VAR file format and transfer the original data directly without any need of conversion. This is what we enabled now.</p>

<h2>Background processing infrastructure</h2>

<p>Kiwi is a web based application. Web applications are designed around quick request and responses with relatively short connection lifetimes between server and clients. However the main job of Kiwi is to process and transfer possibly very large sizes of data. This type of workload necessitates some kind of a background job processing infrastructure because it takes longer times to completely fulfill the incoming requests.</p>

<p>In Kiwi any data transfer request is represented as a background job, meaning that the user&rsquo;s request is processsed asychronously in the background while he can continue doing other things in the application. We&rsquo;re using a framework called <a href="http://hangfire.io/">Hangfire</a> that keeps track of background jobs and manages their state transitions. Hangfire also allows us to simplify the deployment of Kiwi as it hosts the background threads right inside the web application. There is no need for a separate installation.</p>

<p>We want to delight our users and make Kiwi easy and fun to use. We wanted to avoid the need of manually refreshing web pages to find out if a process has finished or not. We&rsquo;re using <a href="http://signalr.net">SignalR</a> to notify user interface about the state changes of the background processes. With this technology, users don&rsquo;t have to do anything manually. The page automatically updates itself in real time as the latest information becomes available.</p>

<h2>Performance, reliability and error handling</h2>

<p>The main difference between a toy software and a real world software is that the former is made for demos and happy path scenarios while the latter is armed with capabilities for handling various real world inputs and conditions. Even when it fails it should fail gracefully with proper and helpful error messages, preferably pointing to some documentation on how to proceed further.</p>

<p>As all developers know very well, error logging is crucial for an application&rsquo;s success. It&rsquo;s one of the most important ways to diagnose the problems that are out there in production. We&rsquo;re using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah/">Elmah</a> for this purpose.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re making extra effort to find the balance between performance and reliability. Because Kiwi will probably deal with various sizes of data from small to very large depending on the survey, it has to be able to favor reliability over performance when necessary. For those scenarios with very large input data we&rsquo;ve been working on reducing the memory footprint and trade it off with some performance. In these scenarios loading all the data to the memory is simply not acceptable.</p>

<h2>Non-technical stuff</h2>

<p>Creating a product comes with a few standard challenges.</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re creating a company logo and a logo for Kiwi.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve created the first draft of our license agreement. We&rsquo;re now looking for a professional who can review it and help us finalize it.</li>
<li>Deniz is continuously enhancing the documentation. It will be hosted on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>. Currently it&rsquo;s a separate entity but we want to incorporate it with the software in a way that Kiwi will know how to link to this documentation based on a given context and situation. I&rsquo;m not sure if we can finish this before the first version but it&rsquo;s definitely on our list.</li>
</ul>


<p>When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> is applied to software development, it reveals that the last %20 of the development takes as much time as the first %80. Sounds scary huh? : ) but it certainly has some truth in it. We&rsquo;re now very close to 100% for the first version of Kiwi. The remaining things on our todo list are non-technical, the things around actually releasing the product.</p>

<p>Before wrapping this up I would like to thank our employer <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/">NIPO Software</a> for their great support. We&rsquo;re frequently in touch and getting a lot of feedback. Really guys&hellip; Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep writing as things happen. Good and bad. Transparency is the goal here.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and as usual: feel free to drop a comment.</p>
