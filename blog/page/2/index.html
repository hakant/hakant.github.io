	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Have you ever thought why disposition pattern is designed the way it is? I hadn&rsquo;t. Sometimes we learn things along the way and never question its basics or roots again. We do it that way because we&rsquo;re told so or because it just worked so far and we never looked back.</p>

<p>Nicole Calinoiu&rsquo;s talk from NDC Oslo taught me many things one of which is how IDisposable pattern is designed and became the way it is. It&rsquo;s an awesome talk, one that I can strongly recommend. I&rsquo;ve embedded the video at the bottom of this page, make sure to check it out.</p>

<p>I saw the talk twice and wanted to take notes for myself. Notes that I can revisit when the details get blurry in my head six months or a year down the path. I&rsquo;ve also double checked or dived into some other details through MSDN and included those in the notes as well.</p>

<h2>Finalization</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Never ever set any object to NULL to &ldquo;help&rdquo; Garbage Collector do his job. You&rsquo;re not helping him and even making things worse.</p></li>
<li><p>Although .NET Runtime knows about cleaning up memory really well, it can&rsquo;t possibly know the shared resources (file system, network connections, registery etc&hellip;) that your objects are using. Finalization is the object&rsquo;s opportunity to cleanup those resources when it&rsquo;s about to be removed from the memory.</p></li>
<li><p>If a .NET object overrides the method Object.Finalize(), the Garbage Collector will call the Finalize method before cleaning up the object from memory.</p></li>
<li><p>If the object does not override the method Finalize, Garbage Collector doesn&rsquo;t finalize the object (obviously). Here is what <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.finalize%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN</a> says:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>The garbage collector does not mark types derived from Object for finalization unless they override the Finalize method.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Now comes the part that&rsquo;s obscure in the MSDN documentation. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.finalize%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN</a> says (emphasis mine):</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>You should override Finalize for a class that uses <strong>unmanaged resources</strong> such as file handles or database connections that must be released when the managed object that uses them is discarded during garbage collection.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unmanaged resources</strong> mentioned in the documentation are <strong>NOT</strong> the managed wrappers. If you have code that directly uses IntPtr and DllImport then you&rsquo;re using unmanaged resources and you need to be thinking about Finalization.</p></li>
<li><p>Managed wrappers have their own Finalizers (hopefully) so it&rsquo;s not your responsibility to supply another Finalizer on top of that. But if you have any code in a class that looks like the one below, then you need a Finalizer for that specific class.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing an <strong>unnecessary</strong> Finalizer comes with a cost: delaying the cleanup process of your objects. Finalization brings extra steps to the cleaning process (adding those objects to Finalization queue and running their Finalization logic in a separate thread) which delay freeing up memory for those objects. So beware.</p></li>
<li><p>Finalizers should not access any managed resources. Any managed resource at that point could already be harvested by garbage collector. So basically none of the managed objects can be trusted to exist. Finalizers should only cleanup the unmanaged resources and return.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Disposition</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Finalization happens when the Garbage Collector &ldquo;feels like it&rdquo;. In general you don&rsquo;t have (and shouldn&rsquo;t take) any control on when the GC is running or not. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to cleanup and let go of those shared resources when they&rsquo;re not needed anymore? Hell yeah. It would be terrible to keep locking a file and wait until GC comes to clean it up. This is exactly why Disposition exists.</p></li>
<li><p>When a class implements IDisposable it is basically declaring that it needs to be cleaned up. Whenever you&rsquo;re done with an IDisposable class and you know you&rsquo;re the <strong>only</strong> one using it or the <strong>owner</strong> of its lifecycle, you need to call its Dispose method to clean it up.</p></li>
<li><p>While Disposing a class and releasing its shared resources, we also want to call Finalize if our class is Finalizable. If you try to do that though, compiler gives an error message: &ldquo;Destructors and Finalize can not be called directly&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s why there is a pattern called IDisposable pattern.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">MSDN documentation on IDisposable interface</a> includes a C# code sample showing how the pattern should be implemented. Notice that because Finalize can not be called directly, another Dispose method is introduced that takes a boolean argument which determines whether the class is being disposed or finalized.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s look at a few important aspects of this implementation:

<ul>
<li>Class keeps track of whether it has been disposed or not and prevents being disposed more than once.</li>
<li>When a class is being Disposed, the Finalization logic also runs. So it tells the Garbage Collector not to bother Finalizing this object anymore (performance gain):</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='csharp'><div class='line'><span class="n">GC</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SuppressFinalize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>These days writing a Finalizer is fairly uncommon. Most .NET applications doesn&rsquo;t require a usage of direct pointer to an unmanaged resource. On top of that, now there is a class called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.safehandle%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" target="_blank">SafeHandle</a> which automatically wraps a pointer to an unmanaged resource. It also handles finalization for you. So this means writing a Finalizer now is very very uncommon. Check the article from Joe Duffy all the way back from 2005: <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2005/12/27/never-write-a-finalizer-again-well-almost-never/" target="_blank">Never write a finalizer again (well, almost never)</a></p></li>
<li><p>The whole purpose of IDisposable pattern is to accomodate Finalization and Disposition under a single solution. But because you may never ever write a finalizer again, the whole IDisposable pattern ends up being designed to cover a very very corner case. And it&rsquo;s unfortunate that nothing has changed since 2005&hellip;</p></li>
</ul>

	</div>
	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2014/12/08/kiwi-updates-and-first-demo/" itemprop="url">Kiwi - Updates & First Demo</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a month since I first wrote about Kiwi. <a href="/blog/2014/11/01/building-kiwi/">In that post</a> I had a &ldquo;demo&rdquo; section where I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was planning to create a screencast to demonstrate how Kiwi works and what it does but didn&rsquo;t get around doing it as part of this blog post. That&rsquo;s high on my to-do list. Another post will be on its way soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the last month a lot has happened. Therefore I had to postpone the demo for a bit longer than I thought. We even had to re-evaluate one of the most essential parts of our software after realizing that our first strategy had some weaknesses that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fix simply because they were outside of our control. So what do you do when a problem is outside of your control? You find another path and bypass it. At least that&rsquo;s what we did but more on that after the demo.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>So first things first. Here is a ~6 minute demo below. Also read on if you&rsquo;re interested in the things that kept us busy in this period.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/S1QcnZmyNpA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>TripleS vs NIPO format</h2>

<p>When we started implementing Kiwi we thought that we could take TripleS files in order to determine the variables in a questionnaire. It was all good, a TripleS file indeed represents the structure of the questionnaire and the variables in it. But we also thought we could always parse the original NIPO data with it, without converting the data to the TripleS format before each data transfer.</p>

<p>It turned out that this assumption was wrong. Later we&rsquo;ve found out a few scenarios where it was simply impossible to predict the structure of the original data file by looking at the TripleS questionnaire structure alone. F.ex. questionnaires with jumps in the data positions or GOTO statements were resulting in undesired shifts in the variable references.</p>

<p>Being able to transfer data multiple times using the original NIPO data (without using any sort of conversion) is one of our design goals. This design will also enable us to completely automate this process where the user sets up the survey once and then Kiwi does the transfer continuously in the background while also displaying some sort of a dashboard to enable <strong>live visualization</strong> of the data collected during the survey.</p>

<h2>Supporting the VAR format</h2>

<p>To realise this design goal we&rsquo;ve decided to add support for VAR file format. VAR file is similar to TripleS file in the sense that they both represent the structure of a questionnaire and list all the variables in a questionnaire. But unlike the TripleS format, the VAR format doesn&rsquo;t require the data to be converted. VAR file represents the original NIPO data. That&rsquo;s exactly what we want.</p>

<p>So now when defining surveys, Kiwi accepts both TripleS and VAR file formats. If TripleS format is used the data also needs to be converted to TripleS. For a NIPO Software client I assume this will almost never be the preferred way. The most effective way will be to use the VAR file format and transfer the original data directly without any need of conversion. This is what we enabled now.</p>

<h2>Background processing infrastructure</h2>

<p>Kiwi is a web based application. Web applications are designed around quick request and responses with relatively short connection lifetimes between server and clients. However the main job of Kiwi is to process and transfer possibly very large sizes of data. This type of workload necessitates some kind of a background job processing infrastructure because it takes longer times to completely fulfill the incoming requests.</p>

<p>In Kiwi any data transfer request is represented as a background job, meaning that the user&rsquo;s request is processsed asychronously in the background while he can continue doing other things in the application. We&rsquo;re using a framework called <a href="http://hangfire.io/">Hangfire</a> that keeps track of background jobs and manages their state transitions. Hangfire also allows us to simplify the deployment of Kiwi as it hosts the background threads right inside the web application. There is no need for a separate installation.</p>

<p>We want to delight our users and make Kiwi easy and fun to use. We wanted to avoid the need of manually refreshing web pages to find out if a process has finished or not. We&rsquo;re using <a href="http://signalr.net">SignalR</a> to notify user interface about the state changes of the background processes. With this technology, users don&rsquo;t have to do anything manually. The page automatically updates itself in real time as the latest information becomes available.</p>

<h2>Performance, reliability and error handling</h2>

<p>The main difference between a toy software and a real world software is that the former is made for demos and happy path scenarios while the latter is armed with capabilities for handling various real world inputs and conditions. Even when it fails it should fail gracefully with proper and helpful error messages, preferably pointing to some documentation on how to proceed further.</p>

<p>As all developers know very well, error logging is crucial for an application&rsquo;s success. It&rsquo;s one of the most important ways to diagnose the problems that are out there in production. We&rsquo;re using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah/">Elmah</a> for this purpose.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re making extra effort to find the balance between performance and reliability. Because Kiwi will probably deal with various sizes of data from small to very large depending on the survey, it has to be able to favor reliability over performance when necessary. For those scenarios with very large input data we&rsquo;ve been working on reducing the memory footprint and trade it off with some performance. In these scenarios loading all the data to the memory is simply not acceptable.</p>

<h2>Non-technical stuff</h2>

<p>Creating a product comes with a few standard challenges.</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re creating a company logo and a logo for Kiwi.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve created the first draft of our license agreement. We&rsquo;re now looking for a professional who can review it and help us finalize it.</li>
<li>Deniz is continuously enhancing the documentation. It will be hosted on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>. Currently it&rsquo;s a separate entity but we want to incorporate it with the software in a way that Kiwi will know how to link to this documentation based on a given context and situation. I&rsquo;m not sure if we can finish this before the first version but it&rsquo;s definitely on our list.</li>
</ul>


<p>When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> is applied to software development, it reveals that the last %20 of the development takes as much time as the first %80. Sounds scary huh? : ) but it certainly has some truth in it. We&rsquo;re now very close to 100% for the first version of Kiwi. The remaining things on our todo list are non-technical, the things around actually releasing the product.</p>

<p>Before wrapping this up I would like to thank our employer <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/">NIPO Software</a> for their great support. We&rsquo;re frequently in touch and getting a lot of feedback. Really guys&hellip; Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep writing as things happen. Good and bad. Transparency is the goal here.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and as usual: feel free to drop a comment.</p>

		<p>I think it was sometime around February 2014 when Deniz Orsel, my colleague from <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a>, came to me and said &ldquo;I need you to build something&hellip;&rdquo;. Later it became apparent that he also already had discussed his idea with <a href="https://twitter.com/serifozcan" target="_blank">Serif Ozcan</a>, another colleague of mine in <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a> and convinced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our customers are frequently asking for a tool like this yet it doesn&rsquo;t really fall under the category of &lsquo;Data collection&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why NIPO Software does not invest in this&rdquo; he said. As he explained, I realized it was a good opportunity and also a win &ndash; win situation for us and NIPO Software. I was convinced.</p>

<p>Startup life, starting a business and creating something valuable for people have always been interesting to me. I&rsquo;ve been developing software for almost 10 years now (wow time flies&hellip;) and I really enjoy doing it. But software by itself does not mean anything. It only finds its meaning in a context where it touches human lives.</p>

<p>Switching between these two worlds: &ldquo;mechanics of software&rdquo; and &ldquo;the context it touches and changes people&rsquo;s lives&rdquo; gives more meaning to what I do and how I work. Starting a business around software and creating products demands this frequent switching and even many more skills related to different disciplines like marketing, sales, legal and trading rules in the country one operates.</p>

<p>Even if we end up making no money or even wasting money, I knew we could learn a lot from this experience as a whole and that&rsquo;s what really matters to me and my friends.</p>

<h2>Ok fine but what is Kiwi?</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/Building_Kiwi/Kiwi_Highlights.png" alt="Kiwi Highlights" /></p>

<p>Not everyone reading this blog is working in the area of market research let alone even familiar with the technical market research terminology. So instead of a single long technical definition I&rsquo;ll try to list some facts about Kiwi:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kiwi is a web based application that can be hosted in the cloud or in customer premises.</li>
<li>Kiwi takes collected data that is either in NIPO or Triple-S format and transfers it to a SQL database in relational format and makes analysis &amp; monitoring a lot easier. Apart from the data itself, Kiwi will also create the questionnaire structure in the target SQL database as a reference.</li>
<li>Kiwi can transfer closed and open data files. It also allows consecutive transfers where it will continue adding to the existing data set in SQL without changing it.</li>
<li>For these reasons Kiwi can be used by any market research company that is utilizing data collection platforms built by NIPO Software or any other platform that supports Triple-S standard.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>I was planning to create a screencast to demonstrate how Kiwi works and what it does but didn&rsquo;t get around doing it as part of this blog post. That&rsquo;s high on my to-do list. Another post will be on its way soon.</p>

<h2>Going forward</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re software developers and technologists. Our biggest strength is our technical side. The first version of Kiwi is more or less completed. We&rsquo;re still in the process of making it more robust and user friendly. We&rsquo;re also preparing a strong documentation. Deploying and using Kiwi should be a piece of cake. As well as troubleshooting it.</p>

<p>On the other hand we&rsquo;re totally newbies in a few other areas. We still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Start a company here in the Netherlands</em>. There are many things we need to figure out around taxation and legal aspects of starting a company and selling a product. It&rsquo;s currently a work in progress.</li>
<li><em>Figure out a pricing strategy</em>. We&rsquo;ve been discussing about this for a while but haven&rsquo;t come to a final decision yet. We&rsquo;re also gathering ideas from friends in NIPO Software.  It turns out that pricing is a much bigger concept than just simply putting a price tag on a product. It involves a bit more than that. Things get especially complicated around the topic of customer support.</li>
<li><em>Create a site for the product and decide on some kind of a payment methodology</em>. The company we&rsquo;re going to start will need a website. The product also needs a site of its own. When Kiwi becomes commercially available there will also be a payment system in place.</li>
</ul>


<p>Still a bunch of things to do. We&rsquo;ve been making steady progress but we&rsquo;re not in a hurry. Going at our own pace. Current target is to release Kiwi no later than 15th of January. No idea what happens next but one thing is clear: it will be adventurous.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and if you have any comments please don&rsquo;t hesitate to add them below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A good friend of mine contacted me a couple of weeks ago and asked if I would accept a freelancing project. Around research and prototyping. Possibly leading to a new architecture for their existing product. The existing architecture didn&rsquo;t allow any further room for the new requirements they had &ndash; he told me during our skype conversation. I thought it was fun and took the offer. R&amp;D and freelancing.. not bad huh!</p>

<p>So as part of the assignment I&rsquo;ve been doing some interesting reasearch and prototyping so why not blog about it as well I thought.</p>

<h2>Going technical:</h2>

<p>One of the requirements is to decouple the system components so that they can be deployed and run on different boxes. So a typical &ldquo;scaling out&rdquo; problem.</p>

<p>The other requirement is to enable these components to talk to each other about the changes happening through-out the system. So these components have to be able to send/receive messages to/from each other. This is especially important after separating these components obviously.</p>

<p>After studying the existing architecture and reading through some code, this was my initial design. I&rsquo;ve changed the application names to something more generic to keep it confidential but the technical idea behind it is still the same:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/SystemArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the key components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>App Server</strong>: The application server is running a mission critical service that needs to be very fast. It is actually orchestrating incoming and outgoing voice calls, can&rsquo;t afford to be slow. Obviously there is also some bookkeeping that the application server does. The states of the calls and users change over time and this kind of application state information is also interesting to the other parts of the system for various reasons like monitoring, dashboards or some other type of actions that needs to be taken.</li>
<li><strong>Web UI</strong>: This is basically where customers will sign in and manage their system and data. They can do administrative work as well as look at various dashboards to see what is going on. This is going to become a self-hosted (yes OWIN) MVC 5 application.</li>
<li><strong>Web API</strong>: Most things that can be done with the Web UI should be done with API as well. So that customers can be creative and build their own solutions &amp; extensions. This will be built with Web API 2.0 and self hosted.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will tell more about the other components in the future posts. But careful readers should have already noticed that some of the requirements beg for a &ldquo;message broker&rdquo; / &ldquo;service bus&rdquo; type of a system in between to coordinate messaging.
Let&rsquo;s talk a bit about <a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> now.</p>

<h2>Redis:</h2>

<p>Here is the official definiton of Redis:</p>

<blockquote><p>Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.</p></blockquote>

<p>At <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a> we&rsquo;ve been using Redis for a while but frankly I didn&rsquo;t know that Redis was also supporting pub/sub messaging. As a solution the first thing that came to my mind was <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a>, which is a message broker. But Redis can do other interesting things as well. So I focused on Redis instead.</p>

<p>Here is what Wikipedia says about the &ldquo;Publish–subscribe pattern&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote><p>In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge of what, if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.</p></blockquote>

<p>And what Redis adds to it:</p>

<blockquote><p>This decoupling of publishers and subscribers can allow for greater scalability and a more dynamic network topology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Redis is also a cache store and a persistent storage. If you tell Redis to do so, it will take occasional snapshots of the data in it&rsquo;s memory and persist it to disk. As you progress through the Redis documentation it feels like Redis is all you need : ) F.ex here is where Redis snapshotting feature is configured:</p>

</div><div class='line'><span class="c">#save 60 10000</span></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Depending on how critical your data is you can specify different levels of aggressiveness. As with everything the more aggressively you save the more stress you put on the system. On the other hand you can disable saving completely which will make Redis a purely caching server.</p>

<p>If you want to quickly get up and running with Redis I recommend the <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-nosql-apps-redis" target="_blank">Pluralsight course from John Sonmez</a>. It does a great job on getting you from zero to sixty.</p>

<h2>Redis on Windows</h2>

<p>Redis is an open source project and only supports Linux. But Microsoft Open Tech group develops and supports a <a href="https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis" target="_blank">Windows port targeting Win64</a>. On the other hand I haven&rsquo;t seen a single source that recommends running Redis Windows in production even though Microsoft claims that it&rsquo;s heavily tested and production ready. General sentiment is like &ldquo;why would you do that when you can just run it on a Linux VM&rdquo; which I can understand for SAAS scenarios.</p>

<p>For the project that I&rsquo;m working on there is also installation scenarios on customer premises so asking them to get a Linux machine is a bit over the top my friend says. So we&rsquo;re willing to give the Microsoft Redis a chance. Hey these guys are also running <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/" target="_blank">Redis on Azure</a> after all&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://servicestack.net/" target="_blank">ServiceStack</a> is one of the frameworks that put focus on Redis. Supporting Redis is one of their selling points:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/ServiceStack.png" alt="ServiceStack products" /></p>

<p>ServiceStack also distributes <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows" target="_blank">MS Open Tech Redis port of Windows on GitHub</a>. If you want to run the Windows version of Redis there are very useful information here on how to install Redis Windows as a service or how to use <a href="http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> to install the Linux version of Redis on a Windows box with virtualization through <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<h2>Redis C# Clients</h2>

<p>There are <a href="http://redis.io/clients" target="_blank">a bunch of clients</a> out there implemented for Redis with various languages. As of this writing this is how the list looks like for C#. The ones that are starred are the recommended clients by Redis.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/RedisCSharpClients.png" alt="Redis C# Clients" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve picked the ServiceStack client over StackExchange because of the richer and nicer to use library. It looks like the StackExchange client is claiming to be the fastest though.</p>

<p>Right after starting to use the latest ServiceStack Redis client I&rsquo;ve noticed that they&rsquo;ve switched to a commercial license with version 4. But <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/ServiceStackV3" target="_blank">the previous version 3</a> continues to be BSD license. So I fell back to this version after finding that out. Version 3 is also a pretty complete library and for my current purposes it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p>Here is how the API looks like (click <a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/img/Redis-annotated.png" target="_blank">here</a> for a version that you can zoom):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/Redis-annotated.png" alt="Redis Client API Overview" /></p>

<h2>A User Scenario</h2>

<p>One of the scenarios that can be implemented with this prototype is as follows (remember the architecture diagram from the beginning of this post):</p>

<ul>
<li>When a user adds a record to the system through the Web UI (management site) the App Server needs to know about that record without going to the database.</li>
<li>When something interesting happens on the App Server the Web UI needs to be notified and then it should refresh the information on the connected clients&#8217; browsers. A typical dashboard scenario which should not require manual page refresh.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It&rsquo;s over. I&rsquo;m back in Amsterdam after an awesome week in Oslo. Great sessions, lots of smart people, delicious food and very good coffee. Inspirations everywhere.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Norwegians were this much into coffee drinking. I can easily say that I didn&rsquo;t drink a single cup of bad coffee in Oslo in 7 days. One of the world&rsquo;s best coffee shop <a href="https://timwendelboe.no/">Tim Wendelboe</a> is also located in Oslo. But more on that later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of stuff and spent time with very smart people.</p>

<p>Like I did with my previous conference visit in Microsoft / Seattle, I&rsquo;ll write down all the sessions I&rsquo;ve attended, together with the links to the video recordings.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the sessions in NDC were recorded. That was a bit of a nice surprise in the beginning of the conference. Deciding which sessions to attended became a lot easier afterwards. Now I can basically see anything I missed if I want.</p>

<h2>Workshops</h2>

<p>Attending the workshops was the best decision we&rsquo;ve made. By far the most educative part of the conference. 2 days of workshop gives enough time to properly dive into a broad topic, allows a good deal of Q/A and lab time.</p>

<p>The workshop I attended was titled as &ldquo;Identity and Access Control for modern web applications and API&rsquo;s&rdquo;. From <a href="https://twitter.com/leastprivilege">Dominick Baier</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BrockLAllen">Brock Allen</a>. 10 out of 10 for those guys. They were well prepared. They were also very responsive to the questions from the attendees.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no video recording here. I have pdf&rsquo;s and lab solutions which I&rsquo;ll share in a next blog post.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve covered everything from the old security techniques to the modern ones. Here are some of the main points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using security tokens and claims based authentication &amp; authorization is the way to go in to the future.</li>
<li>Separating authentication to another shared service is a good technique once you have multiple services in your deployment. This security service will issue access tokens for other services in the system to consume. This avoids repetition of security related code in every other service in the system. Enables DRY. Single point of configuration and control. Good stuff.</li>
<li>Microsoft is already moving in this direction with <a href="http://owin.org/">OWIN</a> and <a href="http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana/an-overview-of-project-katana">Katana</a>. Claims based identity is baked into the framework at the moment. And there are a number of Katana middlewares that implement token based authentication.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve left the workshop with some ideas and improvements that can be applied to <a href="http://nfieldmr.com/get-started.aspx" target="_blank">Nfield</a>. Ideas that can enable securer access scenarios and can make security implementation more elegant.</p>

<h2>Keynote</h2>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/97305189" target="_blank">It’s a Write/Read (Mobile) Web</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re doing anything remotely related to UI or UX design you have to see this keynote. Period.</p>

<p>More and more companies are realizing that the intuitiveness and ease of use of their applications are very critical to their competitive advantage. How many taps or clicks does it take to achieve something in your mobile application? Think again. It&rsquo;s a matter of people using or quiting it.</p>

<p>Luke Wroblewski will blow your mind with the statistics and examples he puts up on the screen.</p>

<h2>Sessions &ndash; 4 June 2014</h2>

<br>


<ul>

<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97318800" target="_blank">Banish Your Inner Critic</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;d read a couple of essays written by <a href="https://twitter.com/denisejacobs">Denise Jacobs</a> about creativity and productivity. I wanted to attend one of her sessions. She explains how to stop (or ignore) your inner critic that tries its best to scare you from failure and to kill your creativity.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97329157" target="_blank">Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97337304" target="_blank">Async C# 5.0 &ndash; Patters For Real World Use</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97344528" target="_blank">Builders versus breakers – 10 online attacks we could have easily prevented</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt">Troy Hunt</a>&rsquo;s talks are like exciting science fiction movies. You don&rsquo;t want it to end, but time flies quickly. The title of the talk is self explanatory. It&rsquo;s about a bunch of very interesting online attacks happened in history and most destructive ones have happened in the last 2 years. Maybe this is a sign for what&rsquo;s about to come in the future. Data theft at its best.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/97349267" target="_blank">Managing Asynchronicity</a></li>
</ul>


<p>One doesn&rsquo;t get to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> in person everyday. Functional programming and asynchronicity are two hot topics of the new era. Crockford talks about what asynchronicity is, its effects to our programs and how we can best test these async scenarios using a testing tool called <a href="http://www.jscheck.org">JSCheck</a>.</p>

<h2>Sessions &ndash; 5 June 2014</h2>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/97408202" target="_blank">Javascript Combinators</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m finding Javascript combinators very interesting. Javascript has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">first class functions</a> meaning that a lot of interesting things can be done with them. Once you start combining and decorating functions with other functions, very interesting ways of expressing programs start to appear.</p>

<p>Surprisingly programs become DSL-like and more readable because instead of &ldquo;HOW&rdquo; the program syntax starts to tell &ldquo;WHAT&rdquo;. Making it more declarative than imperative.</p>

<p>I really loved this session and the way <a href="https://twitter.com/raganwald">Reginald Braithwaite</a> presented it. I&rsquo;m hoping to find time to read his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Javascript-Allong%C3%A9-Reginald-Braithwaite-ebook/dp/B00FLKRCVO">JavaScript Allonge</a>.</p>

<p>As programmers our &ldquo;flow&rdquo; is something sacred to us. When we&rsquo;re concentrated and in flow we must not be interrupted because it annoys us and costs us too much time to get back into flow again.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh">Mark Seemann</a> thinks interruptions are going to happen no matter what. Instead of trying to avoid them he focuses on ways of working that will allow him to get back into flow easier and much faster.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come across a nice <a href="http://gallarotti.github.io/digitalian/commentary/how-to-minimize-distractions-recovery-time/">summary blog post</a> about this session.</p>

<p>This is a useful hands-on session on using GitHub. It&rsquo;s not focused on Git but more about what you can do with GitHub itself. GitHub is more than only Git and has many features for letting developers collaborate on open source projects effectively.</p>

<h2>Sessions &ndash; 6 June 2014</h2>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/84676527" target="_blank">Functional Programming: What? Why? When?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Just like with Douglas Crockford, you don&rsquo;t leave a conference without attending a session given by <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Bob Martin</a>. This is one of those talks with some &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments about functional programming.</p>

<p>One thing that I found really interesting is a book that Uncle Bob mentions during his talk. The book is called <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> which he praised a lot. At some point during his talk he said something along the lines of the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>..almost near the end of the book the authors wrote a couple of pages worth apologies on what&rsquo;s about to come, and then they introduced the assignment statement..</p></blockquote>

<p>This amazed me. They could write almost the whole book without the assignment statement (read as pure functional) and then they introduced it like as if it was a defect in software programs. Funny.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97516214" target="_blank">Data Modeling Examples in the Real World with MongoDB</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97519532" target="_blank">Transforming your C# code to functional style</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>One of the most effective and indulging sessions I&rsquo;ve attended in this conference. I highly recommend everybody to see it. Don&rsquo;t expect complex code examples. <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat Subramaniam</a> uses simple examples to make his point. Just listen to what he has to say about functional programming, he&rsquo;ll open up your mind.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/97530814" target="_blank">How I hacked my way to Norway</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Another Troy Hunt show off session. He talks about a couple of highly effective web attacks. Watch it if you&rsquo;re looking for fun, but basically it all comes down to a couple of main points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Never ever display a login form on an HTTP connection. Even if you&rsquo;re posting that form to an HTTPS endpoint. A man in the middle can change the form to somewhere else and steal your credentials without you knowing it. Turns out that Iranian government used this technique to steal its citizens&#8217; Facebook credentials for a while before Facebook woke up and made their login page HTTPS only.</p></li>
<li><p>Always be careful with SQL injection. If you&rsquo;re using latest frameworks you&rsquo;re mostly covered.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your username &amp; password challenge is computationally costly and time-consuming. If an attacker gets a hold of your user database and decides to convert them to clean text, he should be slowed down. It turns out that simple hashing and salting algorithms are easy to break with rainbow table attacks. Even the ASP.NET Membership implementation from 2010.</p></li>
</ol>


<br>


<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97537675" target="_blank">Towards an Evolutionary Architecture</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97541185" target="_blank">Core Software Design Principles</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is what I want to share right now. Maybe I can dive into a number of these topics in some of my next blog posts. Thanks for reading.</p>
