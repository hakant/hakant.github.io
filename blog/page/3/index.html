	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I think it was sometime around February 2014 when Deniz Orsel, my colleague from <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a>, came to me and said &ldquo;I need you to build something&hellip;&rdquo;. Later it became apparent that he also already had discussed his idea with <a href="https://twitter.com/serifozcan" target="_blank">Serif Ozcan</a>, another colleague of mine in <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a> and convinced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our customers are frequently asking for a tool like this yet it doesn&rsquo;t really fall under the category of &lsquo;Data collection&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why NIPO Software does not invest in this&rdquo; he said. As he explained, I realized it was a good opportunity and also a win &ndash; win situation for us and NIPO Software. I was convinced.</p>

<p>Startup life, starting a business and creating something valuable for people have always been interesting to me. I&rsquo;ve been developing software for almost 10 years now (wow time flies&hellip;) and I really enjoy doing it. But software by itself does not mean anything. It only finds its meaning in a context where it touches human lives.</p>

<p>Switching between these two worlds: &ldquo;mechanics of software&rdquo; and &ldquo;the context it touches and changes people&rsquo;s lives&rdquo; gives more meaning to what I do and how I work. Starting a business around software and creating products demands this frequent switching and even many more skills related to different disciplines like marketing, sales, legal and trading rules in the country one operates.</p>

<p>Even if we end up making no money or even wasting money, I knew we could learn a lot from this experience as a whole and that&rsquo;s what really matters to me and my friends.</p>

<h2>Ok fine but what is Kiwi?</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/Building_Kiwi/Kiwi_Highlights.png" alt="Kiwi Highlights" /></p>

<p>Not everyone reading this blog is working in the area of market research let alone even familiar with the technical market research terminology. So instead of a single long technical definition I&rsquo;ll try to list some facts about Kiwi:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kiwi is a web based application that can be hosted in the cloud or in customer premises.</li>
<li>Kiwi takes collected data that is either in NIPO or Triple-S format and transfers it to a SQL database in relational format and makes analysis &amp; monitoring a lot easier. Apart from the data itself, Kiwi will also create the questionnaire structure in the target SQL database as a reference.</li>
<li>Kiwi can transfer closed and open data files. It also allows consecutive transfers where it will continue adding to the existing data set in SQL without changing it.</li>
<li>For these reasons Kiwi can be used by any market research company that is utilizing data collection platforms built by NIPO Software or any other platform that supports Triple-S standard.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>I was planning to create a screencast to demonstrate how Kiwi works and what it does but didn&rsquo;t get around doing it as part of this blog post. That&rsquo;s high on my to-do list. Another post will be on its way soon.</p>

<h2>Going forward</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re software developers and technologists. Our biggest strength is our technical side. The first version of Kiwi is more or less completed. We&rsquo;re still in the process of making it more robust and user friendly. We&rsquo;re also preparing a strong documentation. Deploying and using Kiwi should be a piece of cake. As well as troubleshooting it.</p>

<p>On the other hand we&rsquo;re totally newbies in a few other areas. We still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Start a company here in the Netherlands</em>. There are many things we need to figure out around taxation and legal aspects of starting a company and selling a product. It&rsquo;s currently a work in progress.</li>
<li><em>Figure out a pricing strategy</em>. We&rsquo;ve been discussing about this for a while but haven&rsquo;t come to a final decision yet. We&rsquo;re also gathering ideas from friends in NIPO Software.  It turns out that pricing is a much bigger concept than just simply putting a price tag on a product. It involves a bit more than that. Things get especially complicated around the topic of customer support.</li>
<li><em>Create a site for the product and decide on some kind of a payment methodology</em>. The company we&rsquo;re going to start will need a website. The product also needs a site of its own. When Kiwi becomes commercially available there will also be a payment system in place.</li>
</ul>


<p>Still a bunch of things to do. We&rsquo;ve been making steady progress but we&rsquo;re not in a hurry. Going at our own pace. Current target is to release Kiwi no later than 15th of January. No idea what happens next but one thing is clear: it will be adventurous.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and if you have any comments please don&rsquo;t hesitate to add them below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A good friend of mine contacted me a couple of weeks ago and asked if I would accept a freelancing project. Around research and prototyping. Possibly leading to a new architecture for their existing product. The existing architecture didn&rsquo;t allow any further room for the new requirements they had &ndash; he told me during our skype conversation. I thought it was fun and took the offer. R&amp;D and freelancing.. not bad huh!</p>

<p>So as part of the assignment I&rsquo;ve been doing some interesting reasearch and prototyping so why not blog about it as well I thought.</p>

<h2>Going technical:</h2>

<p>One of the requirements is to decouple the system components so that they can be deployed and run on different boxes. So a typical &ldquo;scaling out&rdquo; problem.</p>

<p>The other requirement is to enable these components to talk to each other about the changes happening through-out the system. So these components have to be able to send/receive messages to/from each other. This is especially important after separating these components obviously.</p>

<p>After studying the existing architecture and reading through some code, this was my initial design. I&rsquo;ve changed the application names to something more generic to keep it confidential but the technical idea behind it is still the same:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/SystemArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the key components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>App Server</strong>: The application server is running a mission critical service that needs to be very fast. It is actually orchestrating incoming and outgoing voice calls, can&rsquo;t afford to be slow. Obviously there is also some bookkeeping that the application server does. The states of the calls and users change over time and this kind of application state information is also interesting to the other parts of the system for various reasons like monitoring, dashboards or some other type of actions that needs to be taken.</li>
<li><strong>Web UI</strong>: This is basically where customers will sign in and manage their system and data. They can do administrative work as well as look at various dashboards to see what is going on. This is going to become a self-hosted (yes OWIN) MVC 5 application.</li>
<li><strong>Web API</strong>: Most things that can be done with the Web UI should be done with API as well. So that customers can be creative and build their own solutions &amp; extensions. This will be built with Web API 2.0 and self hosted.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will tell more about the other components in the future posts. But careful readers should have already noticed that some of the requirements beg for a &ldquo;message broker&rdquo; / &ldquo;service bus&rdquo; type of a system in between to coordinate messaging.
Let&rsquo;s talk a bit about <a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> now.</p>

<h2>Redis:</h2>

<p>Here is the official definiton of Redis:</p>

<blockquote><p>Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.</p></blockquote>

<p>At <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a> we&rsquo;ve been using Redis for a while but frankly I didn&rsquo;t know that Redis was also supporting pub/sub messaging. As a solution the first thing that came to my mind was <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a>, which is a message broker. But Redis can do other interesting things as well. So I focused on Redis instead.</p>

<p>Here is what Wikipedia says about the &ldquo;Publish–subscribe pattern&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote><p>In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge of what, if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.</p></blockquote>

<p>And what Redis adds to it:</p>

<blockquote><p>This decoupling of publishers and subscribers can allow for greater scalability and a more dynamic network topology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Redis is also a cache store and a persistent storage. If you tell Redis to do so, it will take occasional snapshots of the data in it&rsquo;s memory and persist it to disk. As you progress through the Redis documentation it feels like Redis is all you need : ) F.ex here is where Redis snapshotting feature is configured:</p>

</div><div class='line'><span class="c">#save 60 10000</span></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Depending on how critical your data is you can specify different levels of aggressiveness. As with everything the more aggressively you save the more stress you put on the system. On the other hand you can disable saving completely which will make Redis a purely caching server.</p>

<p>If you want to quickly get up and running with Redis I recommend the <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-nosql-apps-redis" target="_blank">Pluralsight course from John Sonmez</a>. It does a great job on getting you from zero to sixty.</p>

<h2>Redis on Windows</h2>

<p>Redis is an open source project and only supports Linux. But Microsoft Open Tech group develops and supports a <a href="https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis" target="_blank">Windows port targeting Win64</a>. On the other hand I haven&rsquo;t seen a single source that recommends running Redis Windows in production even though Microsoft claims that it&rsquo;s heavily tested and production ready. General sentiment is like &ldquo;why would you do that when you can just run it on a Linux VM&rdquo; which I can understand for SAAS scenarios.</p>

<p>For the project that I&rsquo;m working on there is also installation scenarios on customer premises so asking them to get a Linux machine is a bit over the top my friend says. So we&rsquo;re willing to give the Microsoft Redis a chance. Hey these guys are also running <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/" target="_blank">Redis on Azure</a> after all&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://servicestack.net/" target="_blank">ServiceStack</a> is one of the frameworks that put focus on Redis. Supporting Redis is one of their selling points:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/ServiceStack.png" alt="ServiceStack products" /></p>

<p>ServiceStack also distributes <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows" target="_blank">MS Open Tech Redis port of Windows on GitHub</a>. If you want to run the Windows version of Redis there are very useful information here on how to install Redis Windows as a service or how to use <a href="http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> to install the Linux version of Redis on a Windows box with virtualization through <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<h2>Redis C# Clients</h2>

<p>There are <a href="http://redis.io/clients" target="_blank">a bunch of clients</a> out there implemented for Redis with various languages. As of this writing this is how the list looks like for C#. The ones that are starred are the recommended clients by Redis.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/RedisCSharpClients.png" alt="Redis C# Clients" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve picked the ServiceStack client over StackExchange because of the richer and nicer to use library. It looks like the StackExchange client is claiming to be the fastest though.</p>

<p>Right after starting to use the latest ServiceStack Redis client I&rsquo;ve noticed that they&rsquo;ve switched to a commercial license with version 4. But <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/ServiceStackV3" target="_blank">the previous version 3</a> continues to be BSD license. So I fell back to this version after finding that out. Version 3 is also a pretty complete library and for my current purposes it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p>Here is how the API looks like (click <a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/img/Redis-annotated.png" target="_blank">here</a> for a version that you can zoom):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Playing_Around_With_Redis/Redis-annotated.png" alt="Redis Client API Overview" /></p>

<h2>A User Scenario</h2>

<p>One of the scenarios that can be implemented with this prototype is as follows (remember the architecture diagram from the beginning of this post):</p>

<ul>
<li>When a user adds a record to the system through the Web UI (management site) the App Server needs to know about that record without going to the database.</li>
<li>When something interesting happens on the App Server the Web UI needs to be notified and then it should refresh the information on the connected clients&#8217; browsers. A typical dashboard scenario which should not require manual page refresh.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It&rsquo;s over. I&rsquo;m back in Amsterdam after an awesome week in Oslo. Great sessions, lots of smart people, delicious food and very good coffee. Inspirations everywhere.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Norwegians were this much into coffee drinking. I can easily say that I didn&rsquo;t drink a single cup of bad coffee in Oslo in 7 days. One of the world&rsquo;s best coffee shop <a href="https://timwendelboe.no/">Tim Wendelboe</a> is also located in Oslo. But more on that later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of stuff and spent time with very smart people.</p>

<p>Like I did with my previous conference visit in Microsoft / Seattle, I&rsquo;ll write down all the sessions I&rsquo;ve attended, together with the links to the video recordings.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the sessions in NDC were recorded. That was a bit of a nice surprise in the beginning of the conference. Deciding which sessions to attended became a lot easier afterwards. Now I can basically see anything I missed if I want.</p>

<h2>Workshops</h2>

<p>Attending the workshops was the best decision we&rsquo;ve made. By far the most educative part of the conference. 2 days of workshop gives enough time to properly dive into a broad topic, allows a good deal of Q/A and lab time.</p>

<p>The workshop I attended was titled as &ldquo;Identity and Access Control for modern web applications and API&rsquo;s&rdquo;. From <a href="https://twitter.com/leastprivilege">Dominick Baier</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BrockLAllen">Brock Allen</a>. 10 out of 10 for those guys. They were well prepared. They were also very responsive to the questions from the attendees.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no video recording here. I have pdf&rsquo;s and lab solutions which I&rsquo;ll share in a next blog post.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve covered everything from the old security techniques to the modern ones. Here are some of the main points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using security tokens and claims based authentication &amp; authorization is the way to go in to the future.</li>
<li>Separating authentication to another shared service is a good technique once you have multiple services in your deployment. This security service will issue access tokens for other services in the system to consume. This avoids repetition of security related code in every other service in the system. Enables DRY. Single point of configuration and control. Good stuff.</li>
<li>Microsoft is already moving in this direction with <a href="http://owin.org/">OWIN</a> and <a href="http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana/an-overview-of-project-katana">Katana</a>. Claims based identity is baked into the framework at the moment. And there are a number of Katana middlewares that implement token based authentication.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve left the workshop with some ideas and improvements that can be applied to <a href="http://nfieldmr.com/get-started.aspx" target="_blank">Nfield</a>. Ideas that can enable securer access scenarios and can make security implementation more elegant.</p>

</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;d read a couple of essays written by <a href="https://twitter.com/denisejacobs">Denise Jacobs</a> about creativity and productivity. I wanted to attend one of her sessions. She explains how to stop (or ignore) your inner critic that tries its best to scare you from failure and to kill your creativity.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt">Troy Hunt</a>&rsquo;s talks are like exciting science fiction movies. You don&rsquo;t want it to end, but time flies quickly. The title of the talk is self explanatory. It&rsquo;s about a bunch of very interesting online attacks happened in history and most destructive ones have happened in the last 2 years. Maybe this is a sign for what&rsquo;s about to come in the future. Data theft at its best.</p>

<p>One doesn&rsquo;t get to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> in person everyday. Functional programming and asynchronicity are two hot topics of the new era. Crockford talks about what asynchronicity is, its effects to our programs and how we can best test these async scenarios using a testing tool called <a href="http://www.jscheck.org">JSCheck</a>.</p>

<h2>Sessions &ndash; 5 June 2014</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/97408202" target="_blank">Javascript Combinators</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m finding Javascript combinators very interesting. Javascript has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">first class functions</a> meaning that a lot of interesting things can be done with them. Once you start combining and decorating functions with other functions, very interesting ways of expressing programs start to appear.</p>

<p>Surprisingly programs become DSL-like and more readable because instead of &ldquo;HOW&rdquo; the program syntax starts to tell &ldquo;WHAT&rdquo;. Making it more declarative than imperative.</p>

<p>I really loved this session and the way <a href="https://twitter.com/raganwald">Reginald Braithwaite</a> presented it. I&rsquo;m hoping to find time to read his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Javascript-Allong%C3%A9-Reginald-Braithwaite-ebook/dp/B00FLKRCVO">JavaScript Allonge</a>.</p>

</ul>


<p>As programmers our &ldquo;flow&rdquo; is something sacred to us. When we&rsquo;re concentrated and in flow we must not be interrupted because it annoys us and costs us too much time to get back into flow again.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh">Mark Seemann</a> thinks interruptions are going to happen no matter what. Instead of trying to avoid them he focuses on ways of working that will allow him to get back into flow easier and much faster.</p>

<h2>Sessions &ndash; 6 June 2014</h2>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/84676527" target="_blank">Functional Programming: What? Why? When?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Just like with Douglas Crockford, you don&rsquo;t leave a conference without attending a session given by <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Bob Martin</a>. This is one of those talks with some &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments about functional programming.</p>

<p>One thing that I found really interesting is a book that Uncle Bob mentions during his talk. The book is called <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> which he praised a lot. At some point during his talk he said something along the lines of the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>..almost near the end of the book the authors wrote a couple of pages worth apologies on what&rsquo;s about to come, and then they introduced the assignment statement..</p></blockquote>

<p>This amazed me. They could write almost the whole book without the assignment statement (read as pure functional) and then they introduced it like as if it was a defect in software programs. Funny.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97516214" target="_blank">Data Modeling Examples in the Real World with MongoDB</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/97519532" target="_blank">Transforming your C# code to functional style</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>One of the most effective and indulging sessions I&rsquo;ve attended in this conference. I highly recommend everybody to see it. Don&rsquo;t expect complex code examples. <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat Subramaniam</a> uses simple examples to make his point. Just listen to what he has to say about functional programming, he&rsquo;ll open up your mind.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/97530814" target="_blank">How I hacked my way to Norway</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Another Troy Hunt show off session. He talks about a couple of highly effective web attacks. Watch it if you&rsquo;re looking for fun, but basically it all comes down to a couple of main points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Never ever display a login form on an HTTP connection. Even if you&rsquo;re posting that form to an HTTPS endpoint. A man in the middle can change the form to somewhere else and steal your credentials without you knowing it. Turns out that Iranian government used this technique to steal its citizens&#8217; Facebook credentials for a while before Facebook woke up and made their login page HTTPS only.</p></li>
<li><p>Always be careful with SQL injection. If you&rsquo;re using latest frameworks you&rsquo;re mostly covered.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your username &amp; password challenge is computationally costly and time-consuming. If an attacker gets a hold of your user database and decides to convert them to clean text, he should be slowed down. It turns out that simple hashing and salting algorithms are easy to break with rainbow table attacks. Even the ASP.NET Membership implementation from 2010.</p></li>
</ol>

		<p>Yes! It&rsquo;s happening. We will be at <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/" target="_blank">NDC Oslo 2014</a> with 3 developers from <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com/" target="_blank">NIPO Software</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/bjorn_coltof" target="_blank">Bjorn Coltof</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/serifozcan" target="_blank">Serif Ozcan</a> and I are going to be there between 2-6th of June. We&rsquo;ll be attending the conference as well as the pre-conference workshops. We&rsquo;re all pretty excited and it&rsquo;s going to be awesome. Connect with us if you&rsquo;re also going to be there! We can have a chat over a beer or two. All beers are on NIPO Software! (just testing if Jeroen Noordman, our CEO, is reading this post. I should soon find out).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the conference content. The sessions are so great that you wish you could have mitosis and attend at least a couple of them at the same time. But again life is all about priorities. Clarifying the priorities is tough.</p>

<p>My thought process involved asking myself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I particularly interested in the main subject of this session? (Doh!)</li>
<li>Is this session content something I can find in books, online documents or Pluralsight courses? How original is it?</li>
<li>..and of course it&rsquo;s preferable that I can apply this knowledge somewhere in the office like on <a href="http://nfieldmr.com/get-started.aspx" target="_blank">Nfield</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a bunch of <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/pre-conference-workshops" target="_blank">pre-conference workshops</a> that will take place in the first 2 days, right before the conference starts. First choice had to be made here. This is something you can&rsquo;t change afterwards. It&rsquo;s printed on the ticket.</p>

<p>In the end Bjorn and I picked <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/pre-conference-workshop/identity-workshop/1750" target="_blank">Identity and access control for modern web applications and APIs (Dominick Baier &ndash; Brock Allen)</a> and Serif chose to stay away from us by enrolling in <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/pre-conference-workshop/angularjs-workshop/1865" target="_blank">AngularJS workshop (Scott Allen)</a>. Can&rsquo;t really blame him, I love Scott Allen&rsquo;s <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/scott-allen" target="_blank">Pluralsight courses.</a></p>

<p>The most tricky part in this selection is that all &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; single day workshops are set for 3rd of June. So it becomes very hard to pick two separate single day workshops. This also goes as a feedback to NDC organizers. Don&rsquo;t do that again!</p>

<p>After we hack enough code during these 2 day workshops the actual conference will start. Here are screenshots from the agenda together with my selections based on priority. I&rsquo;ve color coded the talks on the calender:</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">Highest priority.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Middle priority. Go to this one if you can&rsquo;t somehow make the one above.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:green">Low priority. Go to this one if you can&rsquo;t make neither of above.</span></li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<br/><br/>


<blockquote><h4>UPDATE:</h4>

<p>Things keep changing &amp; improving really FAST on Azure. This post may not reflect the latest capabilities in terms of Disaster Recovery for Azure Applications. Make sure to read the subject on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn251004.aspx">MSDN</a> as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are things we tend to ignore. Things that we don&rsquo;t want to spend time on or think about because there are no immediate benefits. Disaster recovery is one of those topics. The chances are fairly low, but the impact on our business is catastrophic. The consequences can go as far as losing the business completely. Unless there is some sort of a disaster recovery plan in place.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m working with Microsoft Azure on a daily basis as part of my job, I&rsquo;ll be focusing on Azure but the fundamental principles and concepts should be universal for every cloud platform, or even for on premises type scenarios.</p>

<h2>Two key objectives</h2>

<br>


<blockquote><h5>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</h5>

<p>Recovery Time Objective is the maximum amount of time allocated for restoring application functionality.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is usually a requirement coming from the business. Basically the question is how critical is your platform and how much down time can you tolerate in such a catastrophic event?</p>

<blockquote><h5>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</h5>

<p>The recovery point objective (RPO) is the acceptable time window of lost data due to the recovery process.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example, if the RPO is one hour, you must completely back up or replicate the data at least every hour. Once you bring up the application in an alternate datacenter, the backup data may be missing up to an hour of data. Like RTO, critical applications target a much smaller RPO.</p>

<p>These two key objectives determine the approach that needs to be followed and therefore the effort and cost of the whole disaster recovery plan.</p>

<p>The purpose of this blog post is not to describe solutions for each possible combination of these two objectives, but to describe a couple of approaches that can tolerate relatively long recovery time objective (~24 hours) with a more aggressive (so short) recovery point objective.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that having a short RTO and RPO together can be both costly and complex to implement depending on the storage needs of your applications.</p>

<h2>Running business on a single datacenter</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you haven&rsquo;t thought on a disaster recovery plan yet. If your software is deployed on a single datacenter and making use of Azure Storage and/or Azure SQL Database you are at risk of losing your business should your datacenter goes dark due to a disaster or a catastrophic failure.</p>

<p>An Azure datacenter is equipped with fault domains and redundancy to keep your service highly available but these are all inside the datacenter. If the whole datacenter goes down all the compute instances, databases and storage services will go down with it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Disaster_Recovery_On_Azure/Single_Region_Deployment.png" width="500" height="438" title="'Single Region Deployment'" ></p>

<p>Assuming that you still have your software in-house somewhere, there should be no risk of losing the compute instances forever. By creating and deploying the cloud packages on another datacenter the compute instances can be recovered. <strong>The key to business continuity is to be able to recover the data that is stored on Azure Storage and Azure SQL Databases.</strong></p>

<h2>Frequently backup data outside the datacenter</h2>

<p>Whatever the recovery objectives are, backing up application data outside of the datacenter is a must for business continuity. How frequently the data is backed up or synced outside the datacenter will determine the recovery point objective.</p>

<p>When there are backups available outside the datacenter, the environment can be moved to another datacenter by restoring the data and installing compute instances using existing cloud service packages.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Disaster_Recovery_On_Azure/Redeploy_Azure_Datacenter.png" alt="Redeploy to another datacenter" /></p>

<p>This is called &ldquo;redeploy&rdquo; recovery model and as you might already guess has a long recovery time objective. All the individual pieces of the environment needs to be moved to another datacenter and redeployed.</p>

<h2>How to backup Azure data (together with RPO and RTO considerations)</h2>

<br><br>


<h4>1. Azure Storage</h4>

<p>The good news is that Azure Storage Service has built-in replication strategies. Two of them are geographical redundancy, meaning that all storage data is replicated across datacenters. That&rsquo;s exactly what disaster recovery is about.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Disaster_Recovery_On_Azure/Azure_Storage_Redundancy.png" alt="Azure Storage Geo Redundancy" /></p>

<p>The difference between &ldquo;Geo Redundant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Read-Access Geo Redundant&rdquo; is that the latter allows the redundant data to be accessed at all times in a read-only fashion. This brings us to another important point:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here is what Microsoft&rsquo;s documentation say about the estimated azure storage failover time in case of a disaster:  &ldquo;estimated time that the data will be accessible to customers after a disaster is 24 hours.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of these information 3 options appear for backing up the Azure Storage:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Geo-Redundancy</strong>: There is no SLA but RPO is practically very short. RTO is long. Only after about 24 hours the failover process will be completed by Microsoft and the data will be available again.</li>
<li><strong>Read-Access Geo Redundant</strong>: RPO is again the same as above. However almost immediately the redundant data can be accessed (read-only) which allows systems to run in a degraded mode (if they&rsquo;re designed in such a fault tolerant way of course). Then again in 24 hours everything will be fully operational.</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong>: If RTO needs to be shorter, the only option is to look for a third party product that can replicate an azure storage to another datacenter. This redundant storage will always be available in Read/Write mode (since it&rsquo;s just another regular storage account, only in another geographical region).</li>
</ul>


<br>


<h4>2. Azure SQL Databases</h4>

<p>Yesterday I woke up to an <a href="http://view.email.microsoftemail.com/?j=fe9016787161057a71&amp;m=fe621570756503797d1c&amp;ls=fe1817787c60027e711d79&amp;l=fec21c767365017e&amp;s=fe2212717465037a701d78&amp;jb=ff5e177873&amp;ju=fe5711777060017b7611">annoucement from Microsoft</a> introducing new types of databases in Azure with new disaster recovery features:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Disaster_Recovery_On_Azure/DisasterRecoveryPerDatabaseType.png" alt="Disaster Recovery Per Database Type" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each option and see what it means:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Restore to an alternate Azure region</strong>: This phrase means &ldquo;no silver bullet&rdquo;. Basic type database owners are responsible with their own backup and restore operations. Luckily there is a convenient way to backup and restore an Azure SQL Database regardless of its type.</li>
</ul>


<br>


<h5>Automatic Database Export:</h5>

<p>Actually there are a couple of ways to replicate or backup a database. But most of these options have their own shortcomings for disaster recovery. There is a feature called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/azure/ff951624.aspx">Database Copy</a> which creates a <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151176.aspx">transactionally consistent replica</a> of the source database in <strong>the same datacenter.</strong> Because the replica resides in the same datacenter there is no geo-redundancy. But after the copying is completed, this database can be exported to a storage account in another datacenter.</p>

<p>This is exactly what <strong>Automatic Database Export</strong> feature does. It first replicates the database with a copy operation, thus getting a transactionally consistent copy of the database, then exports it to the storage account that is configured. To see how it is configured you can visit <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sql-bi-sap-cloud-crm_all_in_one_place/archive/2013/07/24/sql-azure-automated-database-export.aspx">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>A direct manual export operation itself does not generate a transactionally consistent copy of a database. This means you may end up having an Order item in the database with a missing OrderDetails. Automatic Database Export however takes care of this problem. The documentation was not very clear on that so I asked the man himself:</p>

<br>




<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hakant">@hakant</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Azure">@Azure</a> yes I&#39;m pretty sure it is</p>&mdash; Scott Guthrie (@scottgu) <a href="https://twitter.com/scottgu/statuses/460180886915276801">April 26, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>So we&rsquo;re on the right track here.</p>

<br>


<blockquote><p><strong>Attention:</strong> First part of Automatic Database Export is the replication of the database with Database COPY operation which runs two databases at the same time. This means export operations are partially doubling the database costs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So far so good&hellip; But what determines RTO and RPO for Automatic Database Export? This analysis depends on the frequency and the destination storage configured for the database export operation.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><em>Exporting to a separate storage account on another datacenter:</em></li>
</ul>


<p>In this scenario, the RPO will simply be around [Database Export Frequency]. If the database is exported every 6 hours, in the worst case scenario 6 hours of data may be lost.</p>

<p>RTO is simply the [Database Restore Duration]. No need to wait for Microsoft to execute the Azure Storage failover process. The database export file is immediately available on the storage account in the other datacenter.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><em>Exporting to the primary storage account on the same datacenter:</em></li>
</ul>


<p>In this scenario, we&rsquo;re relying on the Automated Azure Storage Geo-Replication to get the exported database transferred to another datacenter. Since this scenario uses the geo-replication feature of the storage account there won&rsquo;t be any additional costs for geo-reduntant storage. This is nice indeed.</p>

<p>But in the worst case scenario the RPO can go as far as [2 * Database Export Frequency] if the datacenter happens to fail during the geo-replication process. In that case, the last export file won&rsquo;t be available after the failure but only the one before that will be.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the RTO is [Estimated Azure Storage Geo-Failover Time + Database Restore Duration]. Again, Microsoft&rsquo;s estimation for Azure Storage geo-failover is around 24 hours.</p>

<p>So the moral of the story is that having a dedicated separate Azure Storage account on the other datacenter is beneficial for both RPO and RTO. But as usual the downside is financial. The separate storage account is also billed separately. Both for storage and bandwith to transfer the data. Though it&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that Azure Storage is <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/">fairly cheap</a>.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s move to the other disaster recovery features.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Geo-Replication Passive Replica</strong>: Unfortunately there is no documentation available for this mysterious feature yet. Frankly there is no single mention of this feature anywhere else at the time of this writing. So the technique described above for the Basic databases also applies here until Microsoft actually ships this feature or shares more about it. I&rsquo;ll update this section when that happens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active Geo-Replication</strong>: This one is a silver bullet solution. Unfortunately only the Premium database owners can make use of this feature. With Active Geo-Replication, you can create and maintain up to four readable secondary databases across geographic regions. Basically this gives a very short RPO and RTO for the price of running multiple Premium databases (<a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/#basic-standard-and-premium">which is quite a lot</a>). You can read more about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/azure/dn741339.aspx">Active Geo-Replication on MSDN</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>If your business can tolerate larger than ~24 hrs recovery time objective (RTO) Azure provides a couple of inexpensive features that you can already start making use of. These features also require very little effort to setup and you guarantee business continuity in case of a catastrophic event.</p>

<p>The most cost effective strategy is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure your storage account is configured for Geo-Redundancy (default).</li>
<li>Turn on Automatic Database Export and configure a high frequency that makes sense. Keep track of how long this operation takes and adjust your frequency based on that as well.</li>
<li>Set your default azure storage account as the destination of automatic database export. So rely on the geo-redundancy of your storage account.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you need a shorter RTO build up on this strategy. This post is mainly focused on &ldquo;Redeploy&rdquo; pattern. There are other patterns available on MSDN and some are focused on more aggressive RTO&rsquo;s. I recommend reading: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn251004.aspx">Disaster Recovery and High Availability for Azure Applications</a>.</p>
